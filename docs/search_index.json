These will typically be due on Wednesday but this one is moved to Friday because we do not have class on Monday due to Labor Day. Upload your solutions to problems 1–4 by writing them out by hand, scanning them to pdf using a scanning software such as AdobeScan, assembling them into a single PDF, and uploading it to Moodle. Problem 1.5 is to be done using RStudio. To solve it, create an Rmarkdown file, knit it to .html, and upload the .html on Moodle along with the PDF for questions 1-4. There will be time to work on this problem in class on May 23-24. 1.1 Characterize the Solution Set The following augmented matrices are in row echelon form. Decide whether the set of solutions is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space. Briefly justify your answer. \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 7\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) 1.2 Find the General Solution Each of the following matrices is the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.

For full credit, please solve these by hand, doing all row reductions that bring the system of equations to Reduced Row Echelon Form. On future assignments, you can solve problems like this using either RStudio or WolframAlpha. You are welcome (and, in fact, encouraged) to check your answers using software. \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(2,4)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(3,10)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the two points: \\((1,3)\\) and \\((3,11)\\). 1.5 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Using RStudio, enter the augmented matrix of this system, and solve it using the rref command. Type out the general solution to this system of equations. There will be time to do this in class on Wednesday. Your answer to part b should be an infinite solution set. Give two distinct solutions that are realistic in terms of traffic flow. Is it possible to close down the street labeled by \\(x_2\\) for road construction? That is, is it possible to have \\(x_2 = 0\\) and to meet the other conditions?

You can download the Rmd source file for this problem set. The Problem Set covers sections 1.7 Linear Independence and 1.8 Linear Transformations. 3.1 RREF for a set of vectors Suppose that we have five vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2,\\mathsf{v}_3,\\mathsf{v}_4,\\mathsf{v}_5\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) and that the matrix \\(A\\) containing those vectors row reduces as follows \\[ A = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\\\ \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_4 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_5 \\\\ \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\end{array} \\right] \\longrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Do the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\mathsf{v}_4, \\mathsf{v}_5\\) span \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\)? Justify your answer. Give the solution, in parametric form, to the homogeneous system of equations \\(A x = 0\\) for this problem. Give a dependence relation among the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\). Is the vector \\(\\mathsf{v}_3\\) in \\(\\mathrm{span}(\\mathsf{v}_1,\\mathsf{v}_2)\\)? Justify your answer. Suppose that \\(\\mathsf{b} = 5 \\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 - 3 \\mathsf{v}_3 +4 \\mathsf{v}_4 - \\mathsf{v}_5\\). Use what you have done above to write \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) as a different linear combination of \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\) (i.e., with different weights). 3.2 Linear independence and unique expressions. It is an important fact that if a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) is linearly independent then any vector in the span of these vectors can be written as a unique linear combination of those vectors. This property has a fairly simple proof. Let’s suppose that n = 4 for simplicity and that a vector v can be written in two ways as a combination of those vectors: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} v &amp;=&amp; c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; c_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; c_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; d_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; d_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; d_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; d_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\end{array} \\] Then use the definition of linear independence to prove that \\(c_1 = d_1\\), \\(c_2 = d_2\\), \\(c_3 = d_3\\), and \\(c_4 = d_4\\). 3.3 Is the transformation linear? There are three transformations below. If you believe that the transformation is linear, then show it is by showing that the three linear transformation rules apply for arbitrary vectors. If you believe that the transformation is not linear. Then show that one of the rules fails for specific vectors. \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2 + x_3 -1 \\\\ x_1 - x_2 + x_3 + 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 x_1 - 5 x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 3.4 Partial Information about a Linear Transformation We are given that \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^4 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\) is a linear transformation such that: \\[ T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ ~2~ \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} ~2~ \\\\ 3 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}~~2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ ~0~ \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Use this information to compute the value of \\(T\\) below? \\[T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 8 \\\\ ~3~ \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\hskip5in\\] Hint: express the third input vector as a linear combination of the first two. 3.5 Square, Wide, and Tall Matrices In each question below, choose all of the answers that apply, and give a succinct explanation of how you know that it is true.

If the columns span \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) then there is a unique solution to \\(A x = b\\) for all \\(b\\).

The columns of \\(A\\) must span \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\). If the columns span \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) then there is a unique solution to \\(A x = b\\) for all \\(b\\). If \\({\\bf 0}\\) is the only solution to \\(A x = {\\bf 0}\\), then there is a unique solution to \\(A x = b\\) for all \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\). The columns of \\(A\\) span \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) if and only if the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly independent.

This is the easiest way to use RStudio and works great for our course. You can also download the free desktop version of RStudio. If you plan to go on to take more MSCS classes, especially in statistics and data science, you may want to use the desktop version. Download the desktop version following the instructions here: rstudio.com/products. Now, let’s learn how to use R to solve systems of linear equations! Download this Rmd file. First, we will create vectors and matrices Then we will see how to create an augmented matrix and then apply Gaussian Elimination to obtain is reduced row echelon form. Gaussian elimination is performed by the rref() command. However, this command is not loaded into R by default. So we have have to tell RStudio to use the practical math package, which is known as pracma. So we need to run the following command once at the beginning of our session. require(pracma) 6.2 Building Vectors and Matrices A vector in R is a list of data. The simplest way to create a vector is to use the c() command. The letter ‘c’ is short for ‘combine these values into a vector.’ For example, we can make a vector v for the numbers 1,2,3 as follows: v=c(1,2,3) v ## [1] 1 2 3 Note that we had to ask R to display the value of v. This is because the assignment of v doesn’t echo the value to the console. But can see the value of v in the Environment tab in the upper right panel of RStudio. For example, run this command and then check to see that the value of v gets updated in the environment. v=c(1,2,3,4,5,6) It is interesting to note that c() returns a dimensionless vector. So you can treat a vector c() as either a row or a column when you construct a matrix. For example, suppose that we want to make the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We could create this matrix by binding three row vectors: A = rbind(c(1,1,1), c(2,4,8), c(3,9,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 or we could bind three column vectors: A = cbind(c(1,2,3), c(1,4,9), c(1,8,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 6.3 Solving a Linear System Suppose that we want to solve the linear system \\[\\begin{aligned} x + y + z &amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x + 4y + 8z &amp;= 6 \\\\ 3x +9y+27z &amp;=12 \\end{aligned}\\] which has coefficient matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] and target (column) vector \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This is the same matrix A we defined above. Let’s define a vector b and use cbind() to create an augmented matrix which we will name Ab. (We could have just made the full augmented matrix from the start, but using cbind to add a column to a matrix is a skill we will use later in the course!) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 b = c(4,6,12) Ab = cbind(A,b) Ab ## b ## [1,] 1 1 1 4 ## [2,] 2 4 8 6 ## [3,] 3 9 27 12 Now we use the rref() command to apply Gaussian Elimination to produce the reduced row echelon form. (And remember: we had to load this function into R by using the require(pracma) command above.) rref(Ab) ## b ## [1,] 1 0 0 7 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 We conclude that this is a consistent system no free variables. The unique solution is \\[\\begin{align} x&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=-4\\\\ z&amp;=1 \\end{align}\\] We can verify that our answer works by multiplying \\(A\\) by one of the solutions above. Matrix multiplication uses the funny operation %*%. A %*% c(7,-4,1) ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 12 #A %*% c(1,2,3,0,0) Which matches our target \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\] just as we had hoped. 6.4 Solving another Linear System Now let’s find the solution set for the linear system \\[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\\\ -x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +x_3 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 10 \\\\ x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] which corresponds to augmented matrix \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 2 &amp; +1 &amp; +2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 10 \\\\ 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This time, let’s just construct the augmented matrix direclty. Then we define the coefficient matrix \\(A\\). Here we use cbind to combine the vectors into the columns of a matrix named \\(A\\). You can use rbind if you want to combine the vectors into the rows of a matrix. Ab = cbind(c(1,2,-1,1),c(0,1,1,0),c(-1,2,1,-1),c(-1,1,0,-1),c(-1,5,0,-1),c(-2,10,4,-2)) Ab ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 ## [2,] 2 1 2 1 5 10 ## [3,] -1 1 1 0 0 4 ## [4,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 And now let’s row reduce to get RREF. rref(Ab) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -1 -1 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 2 3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 So the set of solutions in parametric form is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + s \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and this is a “plane” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). It is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) because these vectors have 5 coordinates. It is a plane because it is spanned by two vectors that are not on the same line. "]]
