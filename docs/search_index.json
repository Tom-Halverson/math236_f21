These will typically be due on Wednesday but this one is moved to Friday because we do not have class on Monday due to Labor Day. Upload your solutions to problems 1–4 by writing them out by hand, scanning them to pdf using a scanning software such as AdobeScan, assembling them into a single PDF, and uploading it to Moodle. Problem 1.5 is to be done using RStudio. To solve it, create an Rmarkdown file, knit it to .html, and upload the .html on Moodle along with the PDF for questions 1-4. There will be time to work on this problem in class on May 23-24. 1.1 Characterize the Solution Set The following augmented matrices are in row echelon form. Decide whether the set of solutions is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space.

For full credit, please solve these by hand, doing all row reductions that bring the system of equations to Reduced Row Echelon Form. On future assignments, you can solve problems like this using either RStudio or WolframAlpha. You are welcome (and, in fact, encouraged) to check your answers using software. \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(2,4)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(3,10)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the two points: \\((1,3)\\) and \\((3,11)\\). 1.5 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Using RStudio, enter the augmented matrix of this system, and solve it using the rref command. Type out the general solution to this system of equations. There will be time to do this in class on Wednesday. Your answer to part b should be an infinite solution set. Give two distinct solutions that are realistic in terms of traffic flow. Is it possible to close down the street labeled by \\(x_2\\) for road construction? That is, is it possible to have \\(x_2 = 0\\) and to meet the other conditions?

You can download the Rmd source file for this problem set. The Problem Set covers sections 1.7 Linear Independence and 1.8 Linear Transformations. 3.1 RREF for a set of vectors Suppose that we have five vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2,\\mathsf{v}_3,\\mathsf{v}_4,\\mathsf{v}_5\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) and that the matrix \\(A\\) containing those vectors row reduces as follows \\[ A = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\\\ \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_4 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_5 \\\\ \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\end{array} \\right] \\longrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Do the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\mathsf{v}_4, \\mathsf{v}_5\\) span \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\)? Justify your answer. Give the solution, in parametric form, to the homogeneous system of equations \\(A x = 0\\) for this problem. Give a dependence relation among the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\). Is the vector \\(\\mathsf{v}_3\\) in \\(\\mathrm{span}(\\mathsf{v}_1,\\mathsf{v}_2)\\)? Justify your answer. Suppose that \\(\\mathsf{b} = 5 \\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 - 3 \\mathsf{v}_3 +4 \\mathsf{v}_4 - \\mathsf{v}_5\\). Use what you have done above to write \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) as a different linear combination of \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\) (i.e., with different weights). 3.2 Linear independence and unique expressions. It is an important fact that if a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) is linearly independent then any vector in the span of these vectors can be written as a unique linear combination of those vectors. This property has a fairly simple proof. Let’s suppose that n = 4 for simplicity and that a vector v can be written in two ways as a combination of those vectors: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} v &amp;=&amp; c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; c_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; c_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; d_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; d_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; d_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; d_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\end{array} \\] Then use the definition of linear independence to prove that \\(c_1 = d_1\\), \\(c_2 = d_2\\), \\(c_3 = d_3\\), and \\(c_4 = d_4\\). 3.3 Is the transformation linear? There are three transformations below. If you believe that the transformation is linear, then show it is by showing that the three linear transformation rules apply for arbitrary vectors. If you believe that the transformation is not linear. Then show that one of the rules fails for specific vectors. \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2 + x_3 -1 \\\\ x_1 - x_2 + x_3 + 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 x_1 - 5 x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 3.4 Partial Information about a Linear Transformation We are given that \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^4 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\) is a linear transformation such that: \\[ T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ ~2~ \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} ~2~ \\\\ 3 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}~~2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ ~0~ \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Use this information to compute the value of \\(T\\) below? \\[T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 8 \\\\ ~3~ \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\hskip5in\\] Hint: express the third input vector as a linear combination of the first two. 3.5 Square, Wide, and Tall Matrices In each question below, choose all of the answers that apply, and give a succinct explanation of how you know that it is true.

Find the matrix of each of these transformations (hint: use the base, the doorway and the peak of the roof as a guide). \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) 4.3 Matrix of a Nonlinear Transformation? 8fc3c6c399298042bc58de2aeea8eb3ed79f757c This problem illustrates what happens if you try to make the matrix of a transformation that is not linear. Consider the transformation \\(T\\) defined by \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + 1 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] a. Show that this is not a linear transformation by demonstrating, with a specific example, that one of the rules of being linear is not true. Now. let’s see what happens if we compute its matrix anyway. Compute \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_1)\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_2)\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_3)\\), and put the vectors you get in the columns of a matrix \\(A\\). Then compute the product below: \\[ \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}}_{A} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_ 2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\] Explain how the result of this computation demonstrates that \\(T\\) is not linear. 4.4 Inner and Outer Products I hope to give you some time to discuss this in class on Friday Sep 24. We can also think of vectors as matrix. A column vector is an \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix and a row vector is a \\(1 \\times n\\) matrix. Compute the following products. These matrix products are called inner products (or dot products) of the vectors. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\1 \\\\1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] b. Now compute the following products. These are called outer products. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix} =\\hskip3in \\] Row reduce both of the matrices that you get in part b (this should be easy to do by hand,but you can use R if you want to).

Apply, M to v0, call this vector v1, and explain, using how the matrix-vector product works, why v1 represents the number of cars at each location one day later (for simplicity, we assume that each rental is for 1 day). Now apply M to v1 and call it v2. This should represent the number of cars at each location 2 days later. Also compute the square of the matrix M and call it M2.
