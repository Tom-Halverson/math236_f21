These will typically be due on Wednesday but this one is moved to Friday because we do not have class on Monday due to Labor Day. Upload your solutions to problems 1–4 by writing them out by hand, scanning them to pdf using a scanning software such as AdobeScan, assembling them into a single PDF, and uploading it to Moodle. Problem 1.5 is to be done using RStudio. To solve it, create an Rmarkdown file, knit it to .html, and upload the .html on Moodle along with the PDF for questions 1-4. There will be time to work on this problem in class on May 23-24. 1.1 Characterize the Solution Set The following augmented matrices are in row echelon form. Decide whether the set of solutions is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space. Briefly justify your answer. \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 7\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) 1.2 Find the General Solution Each of the following matrices is the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.

For full credit, please solve these by hand, doing all row reductions that bring the system of equations to Reduced Row Echelon Form. On future assignments, you can solve problems like this using either RStudio or WolframAlpha. You are welcome (and, in fact, encouraged) to check your answers using software. \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(2,4)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(3,10)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the two points: \\((1,3)\\) and \\((3,11)\\). 1.5 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Using RStudio, enter the augmented matrix of this system, and solve it using the rref command. Type out the general solution to this system of equations. There will be time to do this in class on Wednesday. Your answer to part b should be an infinite solution set. Give two distinct solutions that are realistic in terms of traffic flow. Is it possible to close down the street labeled by \\(x_2\\) for road construction? That is, is it possible to have \\(x_2 = 0\\) and to meet the other conditions?

You can download the Rmd source file for this problem set. The Problem Set covers sections 1.7 Linear Independence and 1.8 Linear Transformations. 3.1 RREF for a set of vectors Suppose that we have five vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2,\\mathsf{v}_3,\\mathsf{v}_4,\\mathsf{v}_5\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) and that the matrix \\(A\\) containing those vectors row reduces as follows \\[ A = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\\\ \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_4 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_5 \\\\ \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\end{array} \\right] \\longrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Do the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\mathsf{v}_4, \\mathsf{v}_5\\) span \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\)? Justify your answer. Give the solution, in parametric form, to the homogeneous system of equations \\(A x = 0\\) for this problem. Give a dependence relation among the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\). Is the vector \\(\\mathsf{v}_3\\) in \\(\\mathrm{span}(\\mathsf{v}_1,\\mathsf{v}_2)\\)? Justify your answer. Suppose that \\(\\mathsf{b} = 5 \\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 - 3 \\mathsf{v}_3 +4 \\mathsf{v}_4 - \\mathsf{v}_5\\). Use what you have done above to write \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) as a different linear combination of \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\) (i.e., with different weights). 3.2 Linear independence and unique expressions. It is an important fact that if a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) is linearly independent then any vector in the span of these vectors can be written as a unique linear combination of those vectors. This property has a fairly simple proof. Let’s suppose that n = 4 for simplicity and that a vector v can be written in two ways as a combination of those vectors: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} v &amp;=&amp; c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; c_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; c_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; d_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; d_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; d_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; d_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\end{array} \\] Then use the definition of linear independence to prove that \\(c_1 = d_1\\), \\(c_2 = d_2\\), \\(c_3 = d_3\\), and \\(c_4 = d_4\\). 3.3 Is the transformation linear? There are three transformations below. If you believe that the transformation is linear, then show it is by showing that the three linear transformation rules apply for arbitrary vectors. If you believe that the transformation is not linear. Then show that one of the rules fails for specific vectors. \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2 + x_3 -1 \\\\ x_1 - x_2 + x_3 + 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 x_1 - 5 x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 3.4 Partial Information about a Linear Transformation We are given that \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^4 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\) is a linear transformation such that: \\[ T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ ~2~ \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} ~2~ \\\\ 3 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}~~2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ ~0~ \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Use this information to compute the value of \\(T\\) below? \\[T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 8 \\\\ ~3~ \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\hskip5in\\] Hint: express the third input vector as a linear combination of the first two. 3.5 Square, Wide, and Tall Matrices In each question below, choose all of the answers that apply, and give a succinct explanation of how you know that it is true.

Matrix Multiplication, and 2.2 Matrix Inverses. 4.1 Matrix of a Linear Transformation In each example below, find the matrix of the given linear transformation (all of these transformations are linear). Do this by finding where the transformation sends the standard basis vectors \\(\\mathsf{e}_1,\\mathsf{e}_2,\\mathsf{e}_3, \\ldots\\). The transformation \\(T\\) is given by: \\[T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_3 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\\\end{bmatrix}. \\] The transformation \\(T\\) is given by: \\[T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)= \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_1 + x_2 \\\\ x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} x_3 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\] The transformation \\(L: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends the shaded region on the left to the the shaded region on the right such that \\(A\\) maps to \\(A\\), \\(B\\) maps to \\(B\\), \\(C\\) maps to \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) maps to \\(D\\). \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) The transformation \\(R: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends the shaded region on the left to the the shaded region on the right such that \\(A\\) maps to \\(A\\), \\(B\\) maps to \\(B\\), \\(C\\) maps to \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) maps to \\(D\\). \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) The transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends my house on the left to the house on the right. \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) 4.2 Matrix of a Nonlinear Transformation? This problem illustrates what happens if you try to make the matrix of a transformation that is not linear. Consider the transformation \\(T\\) defined below. We can see that it is nonlinear by the fact that one of the coordinates is squared and by the fact that it does not send 0 to 0. \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + 1 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Now, let’s see what happens if we compute a matrix for it anyway. Compute \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_1)\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_2)\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_3)\\), and put the vectors you get in the columns of a matrix \\(A\\). Then compute the product below: \\[ \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}}_{A} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_ 2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\] Explain how the result of this computation demonstrates that \\(T\\) is not linear. 4.3 Inner and Outer Products I hope to give you some time to discuss this in class on Friday Sep 24. We can also think of vectors as matrix. A column vector is an \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix and a row vector is a \\(1 \\times n\\) matrix. Compute the following products. These matrix products are called inner products (or dot products) of the vectors. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\1 \\\\1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\] b. Now compute the following products. These are called outer products. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix} =\\hskip3in \\] Row reduce both of the matrices that you get in part b (this should be easy to do by hand,but you can use R if you want to). How many pivots do you get? Explain why you always get this number of pivots when you row reduce an outer product. 4.4 Archaeological Seriation There may be time to discuss this in class on Friday Sep 24. The matrix \\(A\\) below is used in archaeological dating. Its rows correspond to four different grave sites \\(G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4\\) and its columns correspond to five types of pottery\\(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5\\). There is a 1 in position \\(i\\)-\\(j\\) if pottery type \\(P_j\\) is found in grave \\(G_i\\) (and a 0 otherwise). \\[ A=\\begin{array}{c|ccccc} &amp; P_1 &amp; P_2 &amp; P_3 &amp; P_4 &amp; P_5 \\\\ \\hline G_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_4 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Compute the matrix \\(\\mathbf{G} = A A^T\\), where \\(A^T\\) is the transpose of \\(A\\), meaning that the rows and columns have been interchanged. Give the meaning of the \\(i\\)-\\(j\\) entry of \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) (the entry in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\)). State clearly the meaning of this entry using complete sentences (or sentence) and explain why it has this meaning. 4.5 Rental Car I hope to give you some time to work on this in class on Friday Sep 24. Solve this problem using R and turn in a markdown file knitted to html. A group of Macalester alumni open a rental car company specializing in renting electric cars. As a start, they have opened offices in St. Paul, Rochester, and Duluth. Through market research they find that of the cars rented in St. Paul, 85% will get returned in St. Paul, 9% will get returned in Rochester, and 6% will get returned in Duluth. Of the cars rented in Rochester, 30% will get returned in St. Paul, 60% will get returned in Rochester, and 10% in Duluth. Of the cars rented in Duluth, 35% will get returned in St. Paul, 5% in Rochester, and 60% in Duluth. This information is represented in the matrix below. StP = c(.85,.09,.06) Roch = c(.30,.60,.10) Dul = c(.35,.05,.60) M = cbind(StP,Roch,Dul) M ## StP Roch Dul ## [1,] 0.85 0.3 0.35 ## [2,] 0.09 0.6 0.05 ## [3,] 0.06 0.1 0.60 Such a matrix is called a probability matrix or a stochastic matrix because it contains numbers between 0 and 1 and each of its columns sum to 1. The owners are trying to use this data to estimate how much of their fleet will be at each location on average in the long run. Assume that initially they locate 20 cars in each city. This can be recorded by the vector v0 = c(20,20,20). Apply, M to v0, call this vector v1, and explain, using how the matrix-vector product works, why v1 represents the number of cars at each location one day later (for simplicity, we assume that each rental is for 1 day). Now apply M to v1 and call it v2. This should represent the number of cars at each location 2 days later. Also compute the square of the matrix M and call it M2. Confirm that M2 times v0 is the same as M times v1. Write a for loop that applies M over and over again to see what happens to the distribution of cars in the long-run (we will learn how to do this in class but you can also probably just google it). Does this sequence stabilize or does it keep changing after each application? If it does stabilize, how long does it take to stabilize (to within 0.1 cars at each location). Does the starting distribution matter? Try 4 different starting distributions (with a total of 60 cars) and see what the final distribution looks like in each case. For one of your 4 starting distributions, try all 60 cars at one of the locations. 4.6 Rainy Day in LA I hope to give you some time to discuss this in class on Monday Sep 24. In Los Angeles if it rains today, there is a 50% chance it will rain tomorrow, but it if is sunny today, there is a 90% chance it will be sunny tomorrow. This is modeled in the rain-sunshine probability matrix P. \\[ P = \\begin{array}{c|cc|} &amp;\\text{rain}&amp;\\text{sun}\\\\ \\hline \\text{rain}&amp;1/2&amp;1/10\\\\ \\text{sun}&amp;1/2&amp;9/10\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] "],["important-definitions.html", "Section 5 Important Definitions 5.1 Systems of Equations 5.2 Linear Transformations", " Section 5 Important Definitions 5.1 Systems of Equations Row operations The elementary row operations are 1) swap two rows 2) scale a row by a nonzero scalar 3) replace a row by the sum of that row plus a scalar multiple of another row Linear combination A linear combination of a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) is a sum of the form \\[ x_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + x_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + x_n \\mathsf{v}_n \\] where the weights \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) are real numbers.

This is the easiest way to use RStudio and works great for our course. You can also download the free desktop version of RStudio. If you plan to go on to take more MSCS classes, especially in statistics and data science, you may want to use the desktop version. Download the desktop version following the instructions here: rstudio.com/products. Now, let’s learn how to use R to solve systems of linear equations! Download this Rmd file. First, we will create vectors and matrices Then we will see how to create an augmented matrix and then apply Gaussian Elimination to obtain is reduced row echelon form. Gaussian elimination is performed by the rref() command. However, this command is not loaded into R by default. So we have have to tell RStudio to use the practical math package, which is known as pracma. So we need to run the following command once at the beginning of our session. require(pracma) 7.2 Building Vectors and Matrices A vector in R is a list of data. The simplest way to create a vector is to use the c() command. The letter ‘c’ is short for ‘combine these values into a vector.’ For example, we can make a vector v for the numbers 1,2,3 as follows: v=c(1,2,3) v ## [1] 1 2 3 Note that we had to ask R to display the value of v. This is because the assignment of v doesn’t echo the value to the console. But can see the value of v in the Environment tab in the upper right panel of RStudio. For example, run this command and then check to see that the value of v gets updated in the environment. v=c(1,2,3,4,5,6) It is interesting to note that c() returns a dimensionless vector. So you can treat a vector c() as either a row or a column when you construct a matrix. For example, suppose that we want to make the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We could create this matrix by binding three row vectors: A = rbind(c(1,1,1), c(2,4,8), c(3,9,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 or we could bind three column vectors: A = cbind(c(1,2,3), c(1,4,9), c(1,8,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 7.3 Solving a Linear System Suppose that we want to solve the linear system \\[\\begin{aligned} x + y + z &amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x + 4y + 8z &amp;= 6 \\\\ 3x +9y+27z &amp;=12 \\end{aligned}\\] which has coefficient matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] and target (column) vector \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This is the same matrix A we defined above. Let’s define a vector b and use cbind() to create an augmented matrix which we will name Ab. (We could have just made the full augmented matrix from the start, but using cbind to add a column to a matrix is a skill we will use later in the course!) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 b = c(4,6,12) Ab = cbind(A,b) Ab ## b ## [1,] 1 1 1 4 ## [2,] 2 4 8 6 ## [3,] 3 9 27 12 Now we use the rref() command to apply Gaussian Elimination to produce the reduced row echelon form. (And remember: we had to load this function into R by using the require(pracma) command above.) rref(Ab) ## b ## [1,] 1 0 0 7 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 We conclude that this is a consistent system no free variables. The unique solution is \\[\\begin{align} x&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=-4\\\\ z&amp;=1 \\end{align}\\] We can verify that our answer works by multiplying \\(A\\) by one of the solutions above. Matrix multiplication uses the funny operation %*%. A %*% c(7,-4,1) ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 12 #A %*% c(1,2,3,0,0) Which matches our target \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\] just as we had hoped. 7.4 Solving another Linear System Now let’s find the solution set for the linear system \\[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\\\ -x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +x_3 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 10 \\\\ x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] which corresponds to augmented matrix \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 2 &amp; +1 &amp; +2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 10 \\\\ 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This time, let’s just construct the augmented matrix direclty. Then we define the coefficient matrix \\(A\\). Here we use cbind to combine the vectors into the columns of a matrix named \\(A\\). You can use rbind if you want to combine the vectors into the rows of a matrix. Ab = cbind(c(1,2,-1,1),c(0,1,1,0),c(-1,2,1,-1),c(-1,1,0,-1),c(-1,5,0,-1),c(-2,10,4,-2)) Ab ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 ## [2,] 2 1 2 1 5 10 ## [3,] -1 1 1 0 0 4 ## [4,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 And now let’s row reduce to get RREF. rref(Ab) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -1 -1 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 2 3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 So the set of solutions in parametric form is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + s \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and this is a “plane” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). It is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) because these vectors have 5 coordinates. It is a plane because it is spanned by two vectors that are not on the same line.
