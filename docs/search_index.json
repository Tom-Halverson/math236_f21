These will typically be due on Wednesday but this one is moved to Friday because we do not have class on Monday due to Labor Day. Upload your solutions to problems 1–4 by writing them out by hand, scanning them to pdf using a scanning software such as AdobeScan, assembling them into a single PDF, and uploading it to Moodle. Problem 1.5 is to be done using RStudio. To solve it, create an Rmarkdown file, knit it to .html, and upload the .html on Moodle along with the PDF for questions 1-4. There will be time to work on this problem in class on May 23-24. 1.1 Characterize the Solution Set The following augmented matrices are in row echelon form. Decide whether the set of solutions is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space. Briefly justify your answer. \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 7\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) 1.2 Find the General Solution Each of the following matrices is the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.

For full credit, please solve these by hand, doing all row reductions that bring the system of equations to Reduced Row Echelon Form. On future assignments, you can solve problems like this using either RStudio or WolframAlpha. You are welcome (and, in fact, encouraged) to check your answers using software. \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(2,4)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(3,10)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the two points: \\((1,3)\\) and \\((3,11)\\). 1.5 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Using RStudio, enter the augmented matrix of this system, and solve it using the rref command. Type out the general solution to this system of equations. There will be time to do this in class on Wednesday. Your answer to part b should be an infinite solution set. Give two distinct solutions that are realistic in terms of traffic flow. Is it possible to close down the street labeled by \\(x_2\\) for road construction? That is, is it possible to have \\(x_2 = 0\\) and to meet the other conditions?

You can download the Rmd source file for this problem set. The Problem Set covers sections 1.7 Linear Independence and 1.8 Linear Transformations. 3.1 RREF for a set of vectors Suppose that we have five vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2,\\mathsf{v}_3,\\mathsf{v}_4,\\mathsf{v}_5\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) and that the matrix \\(A\\) containing those vectors row reduces as follows \\[ A = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\\\ \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_4 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_5 \\\\ \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\end{array} \\right] \\longrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Do the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\mathsf{v}_4, \\mathsf{v}_5\\) span \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\)? Justify your answer. Give the solution, in parametric form, to the homogeneous system of equations \\(A x = 0\\) for this problem. Give a dependence relation among the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\). Is the vector \\(\\mathsf{v}_3\\) in \\(\\mathrm{span}(\\mathsf{v}_1,\\mathsf{v}_2)\\)? Justify your answer. Suppose that \\(\\mathsf{b} = 5 \\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 - 3 \\mathsf{v}_3 +4 \\mathsf{v}_4 - \\mathsf{v}_5\\). Use what you have done above to write \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) as a different linear combination of \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\) (i.e., with different weights). 3.2 Linear independence and unique expressions. It is an important fact that if a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) is linearly independent then any vector in the span of these vectors can be written as a unique linear combination of those vectors. This property has a fairly simple proof. Let’s suppose that n = 4 for simplicity and that a vector v can be written in two ways as a combination of those vectors: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} v &amp;=&amp; c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; c_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; c_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; d_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; d_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; d_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; d_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\end{array} \\] Then use the definition of linear independence to prove that \\(c_1 = d_1\\), \\(c_2 = d_2\\), \\(c_3 = d_3\\), and \\(c_4 = d_4\\). 3.3 Is the transformation linear? There are three transformations below. If you believe that the transformation is linear, then show it is by showing that the three linear transformation rules apply for arbitrary vectors. If you believe that the transformation is not linear. Then show that one of the rules fails for specific vectors. \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2 + x_3 -1 \\\\ x_1 - x_2 + x_3 + 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 x_1 - 5 x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 3.4 Partial Information about a Linear Transformation We are given that \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^4 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\) is a linear transformation such that: \\[ T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ ~2~ \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} ~2~ \\\\ 3 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}~~2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ ~0~ \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Use this information to compute the value of \\(T\\) below? \\[T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 8 \\\\ ~3~ \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\hskip5in\\] Hint: express the third input vector as a linear combination of the first two. 3.5 Square, Wide, and Tall Matrices In each question below, choose all of the answers that apply, and give a succinct explanation of how you know that it is true.

Matrix Multiplication, and 2.2 Matrix Inverses. 4.1 Matrix of a Linear Transformation In each example below, find the matrix of the given linear transformation (all of these transformations are linear). Do this by finding where the transformation sends the standard basis vectors \\(\\mathsf{e}_1,\\mathsf{e}_2,\\mathsf{e}_3, \\ldots\\). The transformation \\(T\\) is given by: \\[T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_3 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\\\end{bmatrix}. \\] The transformation \\(T\\) is given by: \\[T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)= \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_1 + x_2 \\\\ x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} x_3 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\] The transformation \\(L: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends the shaded region on the left to the the shaded region on the right such that \\(A\\) maps to \\(A\\), \\(B\\) maps to \\(B\\), \\(C\\) maps to \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) maps to \\(D\\). \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) The transformation \\(R: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends the shaded region on the left to the the shaded region on the right such that \\(A\\) maps to \\(A\\), \\(B\\) maps to \\(B\\), \\(C\\) maps to \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) maps to \\(D\\). \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) The transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends my house on the left to the house on the right. \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) 4.2 Matrix of a Nonlinear Transformation? This problem illustrates what happens if you try to make the matrix of a transformation that is not linear. Consider the transformation \\(T\\) defined below. We can see that it is nonlinear by the fact that one of the coordinates is squared and by the fact that it does not send 0 to 0. \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + 1 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Now, let’s see what happens if we compute a matrix for it anyway. Compute \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_1)\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_2)\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_3)\\), and put the vectors you get in the columns of a matrix \\(A\\). Then compute the product below: \\[ \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}}_{A} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_ 2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\] Explain how the result of this computation demonstrates that \\(T\\) is not linear. 4.3 Inner and Outer Products I hope to give you some time to discuss this in class on Friday Sep 24. We can also think of vectors as matrix. A column vector is an \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix and a row vector is a \\(1 \\times n\\) matrix. Compute the following products. These matrix products are called inner products (or dot products) of the vectors. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\1 \\\\1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\] b. Now compute the following products. These are called outer products. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix} =\\hskip3in \\] Row reduce both of the matrices that you get in part b (this should be easy to do by hand,but you can use R if you want to). How many pivots do you get? Explain why you always get this number of pivots when you row reduce an outer product. 4.4 Archaeological Seriation There may be time to discuss this in class on Friday Sep 24. The matrix \\(A\\) below is used in archaeological dating. Its rows correspond to four different grave sites \\(G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4\\) and its columns correspond to five types of pottery\\(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5\\). There is a 1 in position \\(i\\)-\\(j\\) if pottery type \\(P_j\\) is found in grave \\(G_i\\) (and a 0 otherwise). \\[ A=\\begin{array}{c|ccccc} &amp; P_1 &amp; P_2 &amp; P_3 &amp; P_4 &amp; P_5 \\\\ \\hline G_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_4 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Compute the matrix \\(\\mathbf{G} = A A^T\\), where \\(A^T\\) is the transpose of \\(A\\), meaning that the rows and columns have been interchanged. Give the meaning of the \\(i\\)-\\(j\\) entry of \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) (the entry in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\)). State clearly the meaning of this entry using complete sentences (or sentence) and explain why it has this meaning. 4.5 Rental Car I hope to give you some time to work on this in class on Friday Sep 24. Solve this problem using R and turn in a markdown file knitted to html. A group of Macalester alumni open a rental car company specializing in renting electric cars. As a start, they have opened offices in St. Paul, Rochester, and Duluth. Through market research they find that of the cars rented in St. Paul, 85% will get returned in St. Paul, 9% will get returned in Rochester, and 6% will get returned in Duluth. Of the cars rented in Rochester, 30% will get returned in St. Paul, 60% will get returned in Rochester, and 10% in Duluth. Of the cars rented in Duluth, 35% will get returned in St. Paul, 5% in Rochester, and 60% in Duluth. This information is represented in the matrix below. StP = c(.85,.09,.06) Roch = c(.30,.60,.10) Dul = c(.35,.05,.60) M = cbind(StP,Roch,Dul) M ## StP Roch Dul ## [1,] 0.85 0.3 0.35 ## [2,] 0.09 0.6 0.05 ## [3,] 0.06 0.1 0.60 Such a matrix is called a probability matrix or a stochastic matrix because it contains numbers between 0 and 1 and each of its columns sum to 1. The owners are trying to use this data to estimate how much of their fleet will be at each location on average in the long run. Assume that initially they locate 20 cars in each city. This can be recorded by the vector v0 = c(20,20,20). Apply, M to v0, call this vector v1, and explain, using how the matrix-vector product works, why v1 represents the number of cars at each location one day later (for simplicity, we assume that each rental is for 1 day). Now apply M to v1 and call it v2. This should represent the number of cars at each location 2 days later. Also compute the square of the matrix M and call it M2. Confirm that M2 times v0 is the same as M times v1. Write a for loop that applies M over and over again to see what happens to the distribution of cars in the long-run. Does this sequence stabilize or does it keep changing after each application? If it does stabilize, how long does it take to stabilize (to within 0.1 cars at each location). See the MatrixMultiplication.Rmd activity we did in class as well as Writing Loops. Does the starting distribution matter? Try 4 different starting distributions (with a total of 60 cars) and see what the final distribution looks like in each case. For one of your 4 starting distributions, try all 60 cars at one of the locations. 4.6 Rainy Day in LA I hope to give you some time to discuss this in class on Monday Sep 24. In Los Angeles if it rains today, there is a 50% chance it will rain tomorrow, but it if is sunny today, there is a 90% chance it will be sunny tomorrow. This is modeled in the rain-sunshine probability matrix P. \\[ P = \\begin{array}{c|cc|} &amp;\\text{rain}&amp;\\text{sun}\\\\ \\hline \\text{rain}&amp;1/2&amp;1/10\\\\ \\text{sun}&amp;1/2&amp;9/10\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] This matrix works as follows: if the rain-sunshine probability today is (40, 60) (that is, 40% chance rain and 60% chance sunshine), then the rain-sunshine probability tomorrow is (26, 74) as seen by the calculation below. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 &amp; 1/10 \\\\ 1/2 &amp; 9/10 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 40 \\\\ 60 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 26 \\\\ 74 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Find the rain-sunshine probability the day after tomorrow. Compute \\(P^2\\) and explain the meaning of each of the four entries in the matrix. Find \\(P^{-1}\\) and and use it find the rain-sunshine probability yesterday if the rain-sunshine probability today is (40, 60).

This is the easiest way to use RStudio and works great for our course. You can also download the free desktop version of RStudio. If you plan to go on to take more MSCS classes, especially in statistics and data science, you may want to use the desktop version. Download the desktop version following the instructions here: rstudio.com/products. Now, let’s learn how to use R to solve systems of linear equations! Download this Rmd file. First, we will create vectors and matrices Then we will see how to create an augmented matrix and then apply Gaussian Elimination to obtain is reduced row echelon form. Gaussian elimination is performed by the rref() command. However, this command is not loaded into R by default. So we have have to tell RStudio to use the practical math package, which is known as pracma. So we need to run the following command once at the beginning of our session. require(pracma) 8.2 Building Vectors and Matrices A vector in R is a list of data. The simplest way to create a vector is to use the c() command. The letter ‘c’ is short for ‘combine these values into a vector.’ For example, we can make a vector v for the numbers 1,2,3 as follows: v=c(1,2,3) v ## [1] 1 2 3 Note that we had to ask R to display the value of v. This is because the assignment of v doesn’t echo the value to the console. But can see the value of v in the Environment tab in the upper right panel of RStudio. For example, run this command and then check to see that the value of v gets updated in the environment. v=c(1,2,3,4,5,6) It is interesting to note that c() returns a dimensionless vector. So you can treat a vector c() as either a row or a column when you construct a matrix. For example, suppose that we want to make the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We could create this matrix by binding three row vectors: A = rbind(c(1,1,1), c(2,4,8), c(3,9,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 or we could bind three column vectors: A = cbind(c(1,2,3), c(1,4,9), c(1,8,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 8.3 Solving a Linear System Suppose that we want to solve the linear system \\[\\begin{aligned} x + y + z &amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x + 4y + 8z &amp;= 6 \\\\ 3x +9y+27z &amp;=12 \\end{aligned}\\] which has coefficient matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] and target (column) vector \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This is the same matrix A we defined above. Let’s define a vector b and use cbind() to create an augmented matrix which we will name Ab. (We could have just made the full augmented matrix from the start, but using cbind to add a column to a matrix is a skill we will use later in the course!) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 b = c(4,6,12) Ab = cbind(A,b) Ab ## b ## [1,] 1 1 1 4 ## [2,] 2 4 8 6 ## [3,] 3 9 27 12 Now we use the rref() command to apply Gaussian Elimination to produce the reduced row echelon form. (And remember: we had to load this function into R by using the require(pracma) command above.) rref(Ab) ## b ## [1,] 1 0 0 7 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 We conclude that this is a consistent system no free variables. The unique solution is \\[\\begin{align} x&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=-4\\\\ z&amp;=1 \\end{align}\\] We can verify that our answer works by multiplying \\(A\\) by one of the solutions above. Matrix multiplication uses the funny operation %*%. A %*% c(7,-4,1) ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 12 #A %*% c(1,2,3,0,0) Which matches our target \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\] just as we had hoped. 8.4 Solving another Linear System Now let’s find the solution set for the linear system \\[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\\\ -x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +x_3 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 10 \\\\ x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] which corresponds to augmented matrix \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 2 &amp; +1 &amp; +2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 10 \\\\ 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This time, let’s just construct the augmented matrix direclty. Then we define the coefficient matrix \\(A\\). Here we use cbind to combine the vectors into the columns of a matrix named \\(A\\). You can use rbind if you want to combine the vectors into the rows of a matrix. Ab = cbind(c(1,2,-1,1),c(0,1,1,0),c(-1,2,1,-1),c(-1,1,0,-1),c(-1,5,0,-1),c(-2,10,4,-2)) Ab ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 ## [2,] 2 1 2 1 5 10 ## [3,] -1 1 1 0 0 4 ## [4,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 And now let’s row reduce to get RREF. rref(Ab) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -1 -1 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 2 3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 So the set of solutions in parametric form is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + s \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and this is a “plane” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). It is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) because these vectors have 5 coordinates. It is a plane because it is spanned by two vectors that are not on the same line.

This is telling us that there is some redundancy in the matrix A. Remove columns from A to get a new matrix M whose columns are linearly independent. You can do this by removing the appropriate columns from the code below: M = cbind( # you need to edit this matrix c(3, 0, 0, 1, -2, -4, 1), c(5, -5, 0, 3, 3, 1, 4), c(3, 5, -1, 1, -3, -3, 5), c(4, -1, -2, 0, -1, 2, -3), c(0, 17, 3, 0, -17, -29, 8), c(-4, -1, -5, -2, -1, -4, 3), c(5, 3, -4, -5, -2, -3, -1), c(0, 5, -3, -2, -1, -5, 0), c(37, -10, -27, -29, 4, 7, -24) ) M ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## [1,] 3 5 3 4 0 -4 5 0 37 ## [2,] 0 -5 5 -1 17 -1 3 5 -10 ## [3,] 0 0 -1 -2 3 -5 -4 -3 -27 ## [4,] 1 3 1 0 0 -2 -5 -2 -29 ## [5,] -2 3 -3 -1 -17 -1 -2 -1 4 ## [6,] -4 1 -3 2 -29 -4 -3 -5 7 ## [7,] 1 4 5 -3 8 3 -1 0 -24 rref(M) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 -2 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 -2 0 0 0 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 -3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 -2 0 0 0 3 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## [6,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 ## [7,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Your matrix should now be square (7x7) with linearly independent columns. R has a build in solve command, solve, that works for matrices of this form (i.e., square with linearly independent columns). You can try it here. First you need to un-comment-out the solve command. I have it commented out right now, because it does not work with the matrix M (above) until you remove its redundancies. # solve(M,b) Now, you should get a unique solution to the equation M x = b, since M has no free variables, and it should be one of the solutions to the original question A x = b. Which solution is it? That is, which of the many solutions to A x = b are you getting here (forw which values of the paramters?). Compare this with trying to use solve on the original equation A x = b with linearly dependent columns. The solve command in the next bit of code is commented out. Delete the comment command and try executing it. # solve(A,b) 9.2 A 5 x 6 Numerical Matrix So far, all of the matrices we’ve worked with in this class have integer values. This is only so that the calulations are nice to do by hand. All of our theory works over the real numbers. Here we will look at a real matrix with numerical values, something you might find when dealing with real-world data. B = cbind( c(0.717, -0.274, 0.365, 0.482, -0.362), c(0.587, -0.545, 0.5, -0.407, -0.597), c(-0.441, 0.886, 0.784, -0.831, -0.594), c(0.923, -0.466, 0.222, 0.867, 0.493), c(-0.42, -0.745, -0.02, -0.44, 0.209), c(0.621, 0.049, -0.134, -0.844, -0.31) ) B ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 0.717 0.587 -0.441 0.923 -0.420 0.621 ## [2,] -0.274 -0.545 0.886 -0.466 -0.745 0.049 ## [3,] 0.365 0.500 0.784 0.222 -0.020 -0.134 ## [4,] 0.482 -0.407 -0.831 0.867 -0.440 -0.844 ## [5,] -0.362 -0.597 -0.594 0.493 0.209 -0.310 and here is a vector d in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). d = c(5.886, -4.001, 3.701, -6.621, -2.199) d ## [1] 5.886 -4.001 3.701 -6.621 -2.199 Try answering some of these questions: Are the columns of B linearly independent? Do the columns of B span \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\)? Give the parametric solution to B x = d. What is the geometric form of this solution (e.g., a plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\))? Remove redundancies from the columns of B to get a new matrix B2 and use solve to solve the equation B2 x = d. Which of the parametric solutions to you get. 9.3 Random Matrices The following code generates a random 5 x 5 matrix.

We use a trick here. By putting the assignment in parentheses, it both assigns the matrix and displays it.

In this problem, you will write out a loop in R to apply a matrix over and over again. Here is an example for you to use to compare with. First, define a vector \\(v\\) and a matrix \\(A\\) and multiply \\(Av\\). v = c(10,90) A = cbind(c(.9,.1),c(.5,.5)) A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 54 ## [2,] 46 If we want to appy \\(A\\) to \\(v\\) again and again, we can keep multiplying by \\(A\\): A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 71.6 ## [2,] 28.4 A %*% A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 78.64 ## [2,] 21.36 A %*% A %*% A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 81.456 ## [2,] 18.544 It is better to write a loop to do something like this. The following loop will multiply by A 10 times. Try changing the 10 to 4 (and compare with above). Try changing the 10 to 100. N = 10 # the number of times that we will multiply by A w = c(10,90) # the starting value for (i in 1:N) { # loop as the index i goes from 1 to N w = A %*% w # multiply Aw and replace w with this new vector } w # show the final value of w ## [,1] ## [1,] 83.32564 ## [2,] 16.67436 10.5 Matrix Inverses Give a square matrix ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 -6 1 ## [2,] -2 1 0 ## [3,] -7 5 -1 You find its inverse using solve: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 3 2 ## [3,] 3 8 2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0 ## [2,] 1.776357e-15 1.000000e+00 0 ## [3,] 3.552714e-15 1.776357e-15 1 Note that if you look closely at the last matrix, it is within round off error of the identity. For example, the number 1.776357 e-15 is 0.000000000000001776357. To make it look more like the identity, you can use the command zapsmall, which converts very small numbers like this to 0. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 What happens if you try to invert a matrix that is not invertible. For example in the following matrix, the third column is the sum of the first two, so the columns are linearly dependent. If we try to inverti it A = cbind(c(10,-2,-7),c(-6,1,5),c(4,-1,-2)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 -6 4 ## [2,] -2 1 -1 ## [3,] -7 5 -2 solve(A) ## Error in solve.default(A): system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 5.84328e-18 We get the error that the matrix is singular. This is another term for non-invertible.

It will be closed book but you can bring a 3\" x 5\" notecard with notes written on both sides. These notes should be hand written by you. You do not need to turn in the note card with the exam. There will be some basic calculations, but the problems will focus more on the ideas than on the calculations. I will ask some problems that are very similar to homework problems, Edfinity problems, and examples from class or the videos. I will ask other problems that are somewhat different from things you have done. On these, you are to apply your knowledge in a slightly new setting to demonstrate an even higher mastery of the material. You will be allowed to re-write one problem to earn back half of the points that you lost. This will be due the class period after I hand the exam back. The exam is worth 12% of your course grade as outlined in the syllabus. 11.1.1 Vocabulary and Concepts You should understand these concepts and be able to read and use these terms correctly (see also the important definitions): elementary row operations REF and RREF and pivot positions linear combination span linear independence homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations Understand the geometric relationship between the solutions to \\(Ax = 0\\) and \\(Ax=b\\) Understand Theorem 4 in Section 1.4 which says that the following are equivalent (they are all true or are all false) for an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) For each \\(b\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\), \\(A x = b\\) has a solution Each \\(b\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a linear combination of the columns of \\(A\\) The columns of \\(A\\) span \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) \\(A\\) has a pivot in every row.

Here is another problem in which the goal is to interpret the meaning of matrix multiplication. Here is a graph of the network of domestic airline flights in Korea. They are not located geographically in the plane, but there is a connection if there is a direct flight from one airport to the other. It is common to study these networks using a matrix called the adjacency matrix. Here is the adjacency matrix of this network.

Square the matrix, i.e., compute \\(A^2\\). This amounts to dotting the rows of \\(A\\) with the columns of \\(A\\). Decide what the entries of \\(A^2\\) mean in terms of the network. Multiply \\(A^2\\) by the all 1s vector \\(v\\). What do the entries of that vector mean. 11.2.15 Suppose that you are given four linearly dependent vectors, \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\mathsf{v}_4\\), in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). And suppose that you have a linear transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to\\mathbb{R}^m\\).
