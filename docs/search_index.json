These will typically be due on Wednesday but this one is moved to Friday because we do not have class on Monday due to Labor Day. Upload your solutions to problems 1–4 by writing them out by hand, scanning them to pdf using a scanning software such as AdobeScan, assembling them into a single PDF, and uploading it to Moodle. Problem 1.5 is to be done using RStudio. To solve it, create an Rmarkdown file, knit it to .html, and upload the .html on Moodle along with the PDF for questions 1-4. There will be time to work on this problem in class on May 23-24. 1.1 Characterize the Solution Set The following augmented matrices are in row echelon form. Decide whether the set of solutions is a point, line, plane, or the empty set in 3-space. Briefly justify your answer. \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 7\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]\\) 1.2 Find the General Solution Each of the following matrices is the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.

For full credit, please solve these by hand, doing all row reductions that bring the system of equations to Reduced Row Echelon Form. On future assignments, you can solve problems like this using either RStudio or WolframAlpha. You are welcome (and, in fact, encouraged) to check your answers using software. \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(2,4)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(3,10)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the two points: \\((1,3)\\) and \\((3,11)\\). 1.5 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Using RStudio, enter the augmented matrix of this system, and solve it using the rref command. Type out the general solution to this system of equations. There will be time to do this in class on Wednesday. Your answer to part b should be an infinite solution set. Give two distinct solutions that are realistic in terms of traffic flow. Is it possible to close down the street labeled by \\(x_2\\) for road construction? That is, is it possible to have \\(x_2 = 0\\) and to meet the other conditions?

You can download the Rmd source file for this problem set. The Problem Set covers sections 1.7 Linear Independence and 1.8 Linear Transformations. 3.1 RREF for a set of vectors Suppose that we have five vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2,\\mathsf{v}_3,\\mathsf{v}_4,\\mathsf{v}_5\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\) and that the matrix \\(A\\) containing those vectors row reduces as follows \\[ A = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\\\ \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp; \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_4 &amp;\\mathsf{v}_5 \\\\ \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid &amp; \\mid \\end{array} \\right] \\longrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Do the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\mathsf{v}_4, \\mathsf{v}_5\\) span \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\)? Justify your answer. Give the solution, in parametric form, to the homogeneous system of equations \\(A x = 0\\) for this problem. Give a dependence relation among the vectors \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\). Is the vector \\(\\mathsf{v}_3\\) in \\(\\mathrm{span}(\\mathsf{v}_1,\\mathsf{v}_2)\\)? Justify your answer. Suppose that \\(\\mathsf{b} = 5 \\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 - 3 \\mathsf{v}_3 +4 \\mathsf{v}_4 - \\mathsf{v}_5\\). Use what you have done above to write \\(\\mathsf{b}\\) as a different linear combination of \\(\\mathsf{v_1}, \\mathsf{v_2},\\mathsf{v_3},\\mathsf{v_4}, \\mathsf{v_5}\\) (i.e., with different weights). 3.2 Linear independence and unique expressions. It is an important fact that if a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) is linearly independent then any vector in the span of these vectors can be written as a unique linear combination of those vectors. This property has a fairly simple proof. Let’s suppose that n = 4 for simplicity and that a vector v can be written in two ways as a combination of those vectors: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} v &amp;=&amp; c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; c_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; c_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; d_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 &amp;+&amp; d_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 &amp;+&amp; d_3 \\mathsf{v}_3 &amp;+&amp; d_4 \\mathsf{v}_4 \\end{array} \\] Then use the definition of linear independence to prove that \\(c_1 = d_1\\), \\(c_2 = d_2\\), \\(c_3 = d_3\\), and \\(c_4 = d_4\\). 3.3 Is the transformation linear? There are three transformations below. If you believe that the transformation is linear, then show it is by showing that the three linear transformation rules apply for arbitrary vectors. If you believe that the transformation is not linear. Then show that one of the rules fails for specific vectors. \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2 + x_3 -1 \\\\ x_1 - x_2 + x_3 + 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 x_1 - 5 x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + x_2 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 3.4 Partial Information about a Linear Transformation We are given that \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^4 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\) is a linear transformation such that: \\[ T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ ~2~ \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} ~2~ \\\\ 3 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}~~2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ ~0~ \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] Use this information to compute the value of \\(T\\) below? \\[T\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 8 \\\\ ~3~ \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\hskip5in\\] Hint: express the third input vector as a linear combination of the first two. 3.5 Square, Wide, and Tall Matrices In each question below, choose all of the answers that apply, and give a succinct explanation of how you know that it is true.

Matrix Multiplication, and 2.2 Matrix Inverses. 4.1 Matrix of a Linear Transformation In each example below, find the matrix of the given linear transformation (all of these transformations are linear). Do this by finding where the transformation sends the standard basis vectors \\(\\mathsf{e}_1,\\mathsf{e}_2,\\mathsf{e}_3, \\ldots\\). The transformation \\(T\\) is given by: \\[T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_3 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\\\end{bmatrix}. \\] The transformation \\(T\\) is given by: \\[T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)= \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_1 + x_2 \\\\ x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} x_3 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\] The transformation \\(L: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends the shaded region on the left to the the shaded region on the right such that \\(A\\) maps to \\(A\\), \\(B\\) maps to \\(B\\), \\(C\\) maps to \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) maps to \\(D\\). \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) The transformation \\(R: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends the shaded region on the left to the the shaded region on the right such that \\(A\\) maps to \\(A\\), \\(B\\) maps to \\(B\\), \\(C\\) maps to \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) maps to \\(D\\). \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) The transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) sends my house on the left to the house on the right. \\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) 4.2 Matrix of a Nonlinear Transformation? This problem illustrates what happens if you try to make the matrix of a transformation that is not linear. Consider the transformation \\(T\\) defined below. We can see that it is nonlinear by the fact that one of the coordinates is squared and by the fact that it does not send 0 to 0. \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + 1 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Now, let’s see what happens if we compute a matrix for it anyway. Compute \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_1)\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_2)\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_3)\\), and put the vectors you get in the columns of a matrix \\(A\\). Then compute the product below: \\[ \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}}_{A} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_ 2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\] Explain how the result of this computation demonstrates that \\(T\\) is not linear. 4.3 Inner and Outer Products I hope to give you some time to discuss this in class on Friday Sep 24. We can also think of vectors as matrix. A column vector is an \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix and a row vector is a \\(1 \\times n\\) matrix. Compute the following products. These matrix products are called inner products (or dot products) of the vectors. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\1 \\\\1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\qquad\\qquad \\] b. Now compute the following products. These are called outer products. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix} =\\hskip3in \\] Row reduce both of the matrices that you get in part b (this should be easy to do by hand,but you can use R if you want to). How many pivots do you get? Explain why you always get this number of pivots when you row reduce an outer product. 4.4 Archaeological Seriation There may be time to discuss this in class on Friday Sep 24. The matrix \\(A\\) below is used in archaeological dating. Its rows correspond to four different grave sites \\(G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4\\) and its columns correspond to five types of pottery\\(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5\\). There is a 1 in position \\(i\\)-\\(j\\) if pottery type \\(P_j\\) is found in grave \\(G_i\\) (and a 0 otherwise). \\[ A=\\begin{array}{c|ccccc} &amp; P_1 &amp; P_2 &amp; P_3 &amp; P_4 &amp; P_5 \\\\ \\hline G_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ G_4 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Compute the matrix \\(\\mathbf{G} = A A^T\\), where \\(A^T\\) is the transpose of \\(A\\), meaning that the rows and columns have been interchanged. Give the meaning of the \\(i\\)-\\(j\\) entry of \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) (the entry in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\)). State clearly the meaning of this entry using complete sentences (or sentence) and explain why it has this meaning. 4.5 Rental Car I hope to give you some time to work on this in class on Friday Sep 24. Solve this problem using R and turn in a markdown file knitted to html. A group of Macalester alumni open a rental car company specializing in renting electric cars. As a start, they have opened offices in St. Paul, Rochester, and Duluth. Through market research they find that of the cars rented in St. Paul, 85% will get returned in St. Paul, 9% will get returned in Rochester, and 6% will get returned in Duluth. Of the cars rented in Rochester, 30% will get returned in St. Paul, 60% will get returned in Rochester, and 10% in Duluth. Of the cars rented in Duluth, 35% will get returned in St. Paul, 5% in Rochester, and 60% in Duluth. This information is represented in the matrix below. StP = c(.85,.09,.06) Roch = c(.30,.60,.10) Dul = c(.35,.05,.60) M = cbind(StP,Roch,Dul) M ## StP Roch Dul ## [1,] 0.85 0.3 0.35 ## [2,] 0.09 0.6 0.05 ## [3,] 0.06 0.1 0.60 Such a matrix is called a probability matrix or a stochastic matrix because it contains numbers between 0 and 1 and each of its columns sum to 1. The owners are trying to use this data to estimate how much of their fleet will be at each location on average in the long run. Assume that initially they locate 20 cars in each city. This can be recorded by the vector v0 = c(20,20,20). Apply, M to v0, call this vector v1, and explain, using how the matrix-vector product works, why v1 represents the number of cars at each location one day later (for simplicity, we assume that each rental is for 1 day). Now apply M to v1 and call it v2. This should represent the number of cars at each location 2 days later. Also compute the square of the matrix M and call it M2. Confirm that M2 times v0 is the same as M times v1. Write a for loop that applies M over and over again to see what happens to the distribution of cars in the long-run. Does this sequence stabilize or does it keep changing after each application? If it does stabilize, how long does it take to stabilize (to within 0.1 cars at each location). See the MatrixMultiplication.Rmd activity we did in class as well as Writing Loops. Does the starting distribution matter? Try 4 different starting distributions (with a total of 60 cars) and see what the final distribution looks like in each case. For one of your 4 starting distributions, try all 60 cars at one of the locations. 4.6 Rainy Day in LA I hope to give you some time to discuss this in class on Monday Sep 24. In Los Angeles if it rains today, there is a 50% chance it will rain tomorrow, but it if is sunny today, there is a 90% chance it will be sunny tomorrow. This is modeled in the rain-sunshine probability matrix P. \\[ P = \\begin{array}{c|cc|} &amp;\\text{rain}&amp;\\text{sun}\\\\ \\hline \\text{rain}&amp;1/2&amp;1/10\\\\ \\text{sun}&amp;1/2&amp;9/10\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] This matrix works as follows: if the rain-sunshine probability today is (40, 60) (that is, 40% chance rain and 60% chance sunshine), then the rain-sunshine probability tomorrow is (26, 74) as seen by the calculation below. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 &amp; 1/10 \\\\ 1/2 &amp; 9/10 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 40 \\\\ 60 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 26 \\\\ 74 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Find the rain-sunshine probability the day after tomorrow. Compute \\(P^2\\) and explain the meaning of each of the four entries in the matrix. Find \\(P^{-1}\\) and and use it find the rain-sunshine probability yesterday if the rain-sunshine probability today is (40, 60).

Find a basis for \\(F\\) from among your spanning vectors in the previous part. The previous part gives you spanning. Now you need to argue that the vectors are linearly independent.

Either use the method of “baking in” the conditions or turn it in to a null space and use our methods of finding a null space basis. \\[ Z = \\left\\{ \\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} \\ \\Bigg\\vert\\ \\ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 0, x_4 = 2 x_2 \\ \\right\\}. \\] 6.2 A Tetrahedral Basis In practice, we change bases because problems are computationally easier in another coordinate system or because we learn something by looking at a problem from the point of view of a different coordinate system. The following example illustrates this with ideas that arises both in chemistry and computer graphics. Below is the tetrahedral molecule methane, \\(\\mathsf{CH}_4\\). Its coordinates can be described in 3-dimensional space by the vectors below. \\[ \\mathsf{C}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathsf{H}_1=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{6}} \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathsf{H}_2=\\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{3}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{6}} \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathsf{H}_3=\\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{3}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{6}} \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathsf{H}_4=\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\\\0 \\\\-\\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{6}} \\end{bmatrix} \\] Find a dependence relation among the vectors \\(\\mathsf{H}_1, \\mathsf{H}_2, \\mathsf{H_3}, \\mathsf{H_4}.\\) Hint: add them together (you can do it “by hand” by just looking at the sum). We can see visually that the set \\(\\mathcal{M} = \\{ \\mathsf{H}_1, \\mathsf{H}_2, \\mathsf{H_3} \\}\\) is a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), which we will call the tetrahedral basis. You can see from the plot that these vectors are linearly independent (not all on the same plane). Give the coordinates of each of the vectors \\(\\mathsf{H}_1, \\mathsf{H}_2,\\mathsf{H}_3,\\mathsf{H}_4\\) in the \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) basis (for \\(\\mathsf{H}_4\\) you will need to use part a). In chemistry and physics, we are interested in symmetry operations. These are linear transformations such that the atom looks the same after the transformation as it did before. For example one such operation is rotation \\(r\\) by 120\\(^o\\) around the \\(\\mathsf{H}_4\\) axis. This rotation sends \\(\\mathsf{H}_1\\) to \\(\\mathsf{H}_3\\), \\(\\mathsf{H}_3\\) to \\(\\mathsf{H}_2\\), and \\(\\mathsf{H}_2\\) to \\(\\mathsf{H}_1\\). Give the matrix of \\(r\\) in the \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) basis. The columns should be the result of applying the symmetry operation to each of the basis vectors and then expressing the answer in the \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) basis. Show, by multiplying by hand, that your matrix \\(r\\) sends \\(\\mathsf{H}_1\\) to \\(\\mathsf{H}_3\\), \\(\\mathsf{H}_3\\) to \\(\\mathsf{H}_2\\), \\(\\mathsf{H}_2\\) to \\(\\mathsf{H}_1\\), and \\(\\mathsf{H}_4\\) to \\(\\mathsf{H}_4\\). Another symmetry operation is a rotation \\(s\\) by \\(180^o\\) around the axis that passes through the midpoing between \\(\\mathsf{H}_1\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}_2\\) and the midpoint between \\(\\mathsf{H}_3\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}_4\\). This rotation exchanges \\(\\mathsf{H}_1\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}_2\\) and exchanges \\(\\mathsf{H}_3\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}_4\\). Find the matrix of \\(s\\) in the \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) basis. By hand, apply it to each of the four hydrogen atoms and show that they go to the right place. Now we will convert our matrix for \\(r\\) to standard coordinates. Here is the recipe. First, enter the change of basis give the change of basis matrix \\(T\\) that converts from the tetrahedral basis \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to the standard basis \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and compute its inverse that converts from the standard basis back to \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). Here are the atoms for you. H1 = c(0,0,3/(2*sqrt(6))) H2 = c(-1/(2*sqrt(3)),-1/2,-1/(2*sqrt(6))) H3 = c(-1/(2*sqrt(3)),1/2,-1/(2*sqrt(6))) H4 = c(1/sqrt(3),0,-1/(2*sqrt(6))) Now, enter the matrix of the rotation \\(r\\) from part c above. It is entered as the all 0s matrix right now. You need to enter your correct entries. r.M = cbind(c(0,0,0),c(0,0,0),c(0,0,0)) rownames(r.M) &lt;- c(&quot;H1&quot;,&quot;H2&quot;,&quot;H3&quot;) colnames(r.M) &lt;- c(&quot;H1&quot;,&quot;H2&quot;,&quot;H3&quot;) r.M ## H1 H2 H3 ## H1 0 0 0 ## H2 0 0 0 ## H3 0 0 0 Compute the matrix of \\([r]_\\mathcal{S}\\) in the standard basis by computing the matrix product below. Notice that, working from right to left, it first converts from standard coordinates to \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) coordinates. Then it does the rotation in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) coordinates. Then it converts the answer back to standard coordinates. Multiply this matrix (using R) by each of the hydrogen atoms (but now in standard coordinates) and see that they go to the right place. The point of this exercise is that the problem is much easier and nicer in the \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) basis, which is well-suited to the problem. 6.3 Matrix Rank Fill in the entries of the table with T = true or F = false or I** = not enough information to know.

(m) There is a vector \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}^8\\) that can be written as a linear combination of the columns of \\(\\mathsf{A}\\) in more than one way.

Give a basis of \\(S\\) that has the nice standard basis property (i.e., the 0s and 1s property). For the two vectors below, decide if they are in \\(S\\). If the vector is in \\(S\\) then give its coordinates in each of your bases from parts (a) and (b).

This is true if and only if \\(A\\) has a pivot in every column so that there are no free variables. linear dependence Conversely, a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly dependent if there exist scalars \\(c_1, c_2,\\ldots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) that are not all equal to 0 such that \\[ \\mathsf{0} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n \\] This is called a dependence relation among the vectors. Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(\\mathsf{x} = [c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n]^{\\top}\\) is a nontrivial solution to \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{0}\\). 7.2 Linear Transformations linear transformation A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a linear transformation if the following three properties hold: \\(T({\\bf 0}) = {\\bf 0}\\). \\(T(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{v}) = T(\\mathsf{u}) + T(\\mathsf{v})\\) for all vectors \\(\\mathsf{u},\\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). \\(T(c \\mathsf{u}) = c T(\\mathsf{u})\\) for all vectors \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and all scalars \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). These properties say that \\(T\\) sends 0 to 0 and is preserves addition and scalar multiplication. onto A linear transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) with matrix \\(A\\) is onto if for every \\(\\mathsf{b}\\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) there is at least one \\(\\mathsf{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) so that \\(T(\\mathsf{v}) = A \\mathsf{v}= \\mathsf{b}\\) The function is onto if \\(A\\) has a pivot in every row. onee-to-one A linear transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) with matrix \\(A\\) is one-to-one if for every \\(\\mathsf{b}\\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) there is at most one \\(\\mathsf{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) so that \\(T(\\mathsf{v}) = A \\mathsf{v}= \\mathsf{b}\\) The function is one-to-one if \\(A\\) has a pivot in every column. 7.3 Vector Spaces span A set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) span a vector space \\(V\\) if for every \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in V\\) there exist a set of scalars (weights) \\(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\[ \\mathsf{v} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n. \\] Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(\\mathsf{x} = [c_1, \\ldots, c_n]^{\\top}\\) is a solution to \\(A x = \\mathsf{v}\\). linear independence A set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2,\\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly independent if the only way to write \\[ \\mathsf{0} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n \\] is with \\(c_1 = c_2 = \\cdots = c_n = 0\\). Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(A x = \\mathsf{0}\\) has only the trivial solution. linear dependence Conversely, a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly dependent if there exist scalars \\(c_1, c_2,\\ldots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) that are not all equal to 0 such that \\[ \\mathsf{0} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n \\] This is called a dependence relation among the vectors. Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(\\mathsf{x} = [c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n]^{\\top}\\) is a nontrivial solution to \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{0}\\). linear transformation A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a linear transformation when: \\(T(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{v}) = T(\\mathsf{u}) + T(\\mathsf{v})\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}, \\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (preserves addition) \\(T(c \\mathsf{u} ) = c T(\\mathsf{u})\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (preserves scalar multiplication). It follows from these that also \\(T(\\mathsf{0}) = \\mathsf{0}\\). one-to-one A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a one-to-one when: for all \\(\\mathsf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) there is at most one \\(\\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = \\mathsf{y}\\). onto A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a onto when: for all \\(\\mathsf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) there is at least one \\(\\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = \\mathsf{y}\\). subspace A subset \\(S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a subspace when: \\(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{v} \\in S\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}, \\mathsf{v} \\in S\\) (closed under addition) \\(c \\mathsf{u} \\in S\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}\\in S\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (closed under scalar multiplication) It follows from these that also \\(\\mathsf{0} \\in S\\). basis A basis of a vector space (or subspace) \\(V\\) is a set of vectors \\(\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\}\\) in \\(V\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) span \\(V\\) \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly independent Equivalently, one can say that \\(\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\}\\) is a basis of \\(V\\) if for every vector \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in V\\) there is a unique set of scalars \\(c_1, \\ldots, c_n\\) such that \\[ \\mathsf{v} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n. \\] (The fact that there is a set of vectors comes from the span; the fact that they are unique comes from linear independence). dimension The dimension of a subspace \\(W\\) is the number of vectors in any basis of \\(W\\). This is also the fewest number of vectors required to span the subspace. 7.4 Matrices invertible The square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is invertible when there exists an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A^{-1}\\) such that \\(A A^{-1} = I = A^{-1} A\\). The Invertible Matrix Theorem collects over two dozen equivalent conditions, each of which guarantees that \\(A\\) is invertible. null space The null space \\(\\mbox{Nul}(A) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the set of solutions to the homogeneous equation \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathbf{0}\\)&gt; We also write this as \\[ \\mbox{Nul}(A) = \\{ \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\} \\] Connection to Linear Transformations: If \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = A \\mathsf{x}\\), then the kernel of \\(T\\) is the null space of matrix \\(A\\). column space The column space \\(\\mbox{Col}(A) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m\\) of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of \\(A\\). For \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{a}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathsf{a}_n \\end{bmatrix}\\), we have \\[ \\mbox{Col}(A) = \\mbox{span} ( \\mathsf{a}_1, \\mathsf{a}_2, \\ldots , \\mathsf{a}_n ) \\] We also write this as \\[ \\mbox{Col}(A) = \\{ \\mathsf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m : \\mathsf{b} = A \\mathsf{x} \\mbox{ for some } \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\}. \\] Connection to Linear Transformations: If \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = A \\mathsf{x}\\), then the range (also called the image) of \\(T\\) is the column space of matrix \\(A\\). rank The rank of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the dimension of the column space of \\(A\\). This is also the number of pivot columns of the matrix.

This is the easiest way to use RStudio and works great for our course. You can also download the free desktop version of RStudio. If you plan to go on to take more MSCS classes, especially in statistics and data science, you may want to use the desktop version. Download the desktop version following the instructions here: rstudio.com/products. Now, let’s learn how to use R to solve systems of linear equations! Download this Rmd file. First, we will create vectors and matrices Then we will see how to create an augmented matrix and then apply Gaussian Elimination to obtain is reduced row echelon form. Gaussian elimination is performed by the rref() command. However, this command is not loaded into R by default. So we have have to tell RStudio to use the practical math package, which is known as pracma. So we need to run the following command once at the beginning of our session. require(pracma) 9.2 Building Vectors and Matrices A vector in R is a list of data. The simplest way to create a vector is to use the c() command. The letter ‘c’ is short for ‘combine these values into a vector.’ For example, we can make a vector v for the numbers 1,2,3 as follows: v=c(1,2,3) v ## [1] 1 2 3 Note that we had to ask R to display the value of v. This is because the assignment of v doesn’t echo the value to the console. But can see the value of v in the Environment tab in the upper right panel of RStudio. For example, run this command and then check to see that the value of v gets updated in the environment. v=c(1,2,3,4,5,6) It is interesting to note that c() returns a dimensionless vector. So you can treat a vector c() as either a row or a column when you construct a matrix. For example, suppose that we want to make the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We could create this matrix by binding three row vectors: A = rbind(c(1,1,1), c(2,4,8), c(3,9,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 or we could bind three column vectors: A = cbind(c(1,2,3), c(1,4,9), c(1,8,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 9.3 Solving a Linear System Suppose that we want to solve the linear system \\[\\begin{aligned} x + y + z &amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x + 4y + 8z &amp;= 6 \\\\ 3x +9y+27z &amp;=12 \\end{aligned}\\] which has coefficient matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] and target (column) vector \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This is the same matrix A we defined above. Let’s define a vector b and use cbind() to create an augmented matrix which we will name Ab. (We could have just made the full augmented matrix from the start, but using cbind to add a column to a matrix is a skill we will use later in the course!) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 b = c(4,6,12) Ab = cbind(A,b) Ab ## b ## [1,] 1 1 1 4 ## [2,] 2 4 8 6 ## [3,] 3 9 27 12 Now we use the rref() command to apply Gaussian Elimination to produce the reduced row echelon form. (And remember: we had to load this function into R by using the require(pracma) command above.) rref(Ab) ## b ## [1,] 1 0 0 7 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 We conclude that this is a consistent system no free variables. The unique solution is \\[\\begin{align} x&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=-4\\\\ z&amp;=1 \\end{align}\\] We can verify that our answer works by multiplying \\(A\\) by one of the solutions above. Matrix multiplication uses the funny operation %*%. A %*% c(7,-4,1) ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 12 #A %*% c(1,2,3,0,0) Which matches our target \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\] just as we had hoped. 9.4 Solving another Linear System Now let’s find the solution set for the linear system \\[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\\\ -x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +x_3 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 10 \\\\ x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] which corresponds to augmented matrix \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 2 &amp; +1 &amp; +2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 10 \\\\ 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This time, let’s just construct the augmented matrix direclty. Then we define the coefficient matrix \\(A\\). Here we use cbind to combine the vectors into the columns of a matrix named \\(A\\). You can use rbind if you want to combine the vectors into the rows of a matrix. Ab = cbind(c(1,2,-1,1),c(0,1,1,0),c(-1,2,1,-1),c(-1,1,0,-1),c(-1,5,0,-1),c(-2,10,4,-2)) Ab ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 ## [2,] 2 1 2 1 5 10 ## [3,] -1 1 1 0 0 4 ## [4,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 And now let’s row reduce to get RREF. rref(Ab) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -1 -1 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 2 3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 So the set of solutions in parametric form is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + s \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and this is a “plane” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). It is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) because these vectors have 5 coordinates. It is a plane because it is spanned by two vectors that are not on the same line.

You can see that in rref(A). rref(A) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 -2 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 -2 0 0 0 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 -3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 -2 0 0 0 3 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## [6,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 ## [7,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Discuss in your group how you see it. Then write out a dependence relation among the columns by filling in numbers for the weights in this equation \\[ 0 = c_1 \\vec{a}_1 + c_2 \\vec{a}_2 + c_3 \\vec{a}_3 + c_4 \\vec{a}_4 + c_5 \\vec{a}_5 + c_6 \\vec{a}_6 + c_7 \\vec{a}_7 + c_8 \\vec{a}_8 + c_9 \\vec{a}_9. \\] Challenge: give a dependency relation that none of the other groups in the class have. This is telling us that there is some redundancy in the matrix A. Remove columns from A to get a new matrix M whose columns are linearly independent. You can do this by removing the appropriate columns from the code below: M = cbind( # you need to edit this matrix c(3, 0, 0, 1, -2, -4, 1), c(5, -5, 0, 3, 3, 1, 4), c(3, 5, -1, 1, -3, -3, 5), c(4, -1, -2, 0, -1, 2, -3), c(0, 17, 3, 0, -17, -29, 8), c(-4, -1, -5, -2, -1, -4, 3), c(5, 3, -4, -5, -2, -3, -1), c(0, 5, -3, -2, -1, -5, 0), c(37, -10, -27, -29, 4, 7, -24) ) M ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## [1,] 3 5 3 4 0 -4 5 0 37 ## [2,] 0 -5 5 -1 17 -1 3 5 -10 ## [3,] 0 0 -1 -2 3 -5 -4 -3 -27 ## [4,] 1 3 1 0 0 -2 -5 -2 -29 ## [5,] -2 3 -3 -1 -17 -1 -2 -1 4 ## [6,] -4 1 -3 2 -29 -4 -3 -5 7 ## [7,] 1 4 5 -3 8 3 -1 0 -24 rref(M) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 -2 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 -2 0 0 0 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 -3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 -2 0 0 0 3 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## [6,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 ## [7,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Your matrix should now be square (7x7) with linearly independent columns. R has a build in solve command, solve, that works for matrices of this form (i.e., square with linearly independent columns). You can try it here. First you need to un-comment-out the solve command. I have it commented out right now, because it does not work with the matrix M (above) until you remove its redundancies. # solve(M,b) Now, you should get a unique solution to the equation M x = b, since M has no free variables, and it should be one of the solutions to the original question A x = b. Which solution is it? That is, which of the many solutions to A x = b are you getting here (forw which values of the paramters?). Compare this with trying to use solve on the original equation A x = b with linearly dependent columns. The solve command in the next bit of code is commented out. Delete the comment command and try executing it. # solve(A,b) 10.2 A 5 x 6 Numerical Matrix So far, all of the matrices we’ve worked with in this class have integer values. This is only so that the calulations are nice to do by hand. All of our theory works over the real numbers. Here we will look at a real matrix with numerical values, something you might find when dealing with real-world data. B = cbind( c(0.717, -0.274, 0.365, 0.482, -0.362), c(0.587, -0.545, 0.5, -0.407, -0.597), c(-0.441, 0.886, 0.784, -0.831, -0.594), c(0.923, -0.466, 0.222, 0.867, 0.493), c(-0.42, -0.745, -0.02, -0.44, 0.209), c(0.621, 0.049, -0.134, -0.844, -0.31) ) B ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 0.717 0.587 -0.441 0.923 -0.420 0.621 ## [2,] -0.274 -0.545 0.886 -0.466 -0.745 0.049 ## [3,] 0.365 0.500 0.784 0.222 -0.020 -0.134 ## [4,] 0.482 -0.407 -0.831 0.867 -0.440 -0.844 ## [5,] -0.362 -0.597 -0.594 0.493 0.209 -0.310 and here is a vector d in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). d = c(5.886, -4.001, 3.701, -6.621, -2.199) d ## [1] 5.886 -4.001 3.701 -6.621 -2.199 Try answering some of these questions: Are the columns of B linearly independent? Do the columns of B span \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\)? Give the parametric solution to B x = d. What is the geometric form of this solution (e.g., a plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\))? Remove redundancies from the columns of B to get a new matrix B2 and use solve to solve the equation B2 x = d. Which of the parametric solutions to you get. 10.3 Random Matrices The following code generates a random 5 x 5 matrix. Every time you enter it, it will give you a new matrix. Use this to try to figure out how likely it is that a random square matrix has linearly dependent columns.

We use a trick here. By putting the assignment in parentheses, it both assigns the matrix and displays it. (A = cbind(c(1,2,3),c(4,5,6),c(1,1,-1))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 1 ## [2,] 2 5 1 ## [3,] 3 6 -1 (B = cbind(c(1,-1,1),c(1,1,1),c(0,2,1))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 0 ## [2,] -1 1 2 ## [3,] 1 1 1 (C = cbind(c(2,1,1),c(1,0,1),c(1,-3,1),c(3,2,1))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 2 1 1 3 ## [2,] 1 0 -3 2 ## [3,] 1 1 1 1 Multiply these matrices to get \\(AB\\) using the %*% command. As seen here: A %*% B ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -2 6 9 ## [2,] -2 8 11 ## [3,] -4 8 11 Note that \\(BA\\) is not the same as \\(AB\\). B %*% A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 3 9 2 ## [2,] 7 13 -2 ## [3,] 6 15 1 That is, matrix multiplication is not commutative. It can be the case that \\(AB\\) equals \\(BA\\) but most if the time these are not equal. We can multiply \\(BC\\) to get B %*% C ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 3 1 -2 5 ## [2,] 1 1 -2 1 ## [3,] 4 2 -1 6 But \\(CB\\) does not make sense, since \\(C\\) is 3 x 4 and \\(B\\) is 3 x 3. The inner dimensions to not match. R tells us that the matrices are non-conformable. C %*% B ## Error in C %*% B: non-conformable arguments 11.2 Transpose The transpose of a matrix is computed by t(A). For example t(A) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 1 1 -1 t(B) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 -1 1 ## [2,] 1 1 1 ## [3,] 0 2 1 Note that the transpose is order reversing. That is \\[ (AB)^T = B^T A^T. \\] We can see that here ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -2 -2 -4 ## [2,] 6 8 8 ## [3,] 9 11 11 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -2 -2 -4 ## [2,] 6 8 8 ## [3,] 9 11 11 11.3 Identity Matrix The command diag(n) gives the n x n identity matrix.

For example, below are \\(I_3\\), \\(I_4\\), and \\(I_5.\\) diag(3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 diag(4) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 diag(5) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 The identity matrix has the same effect as multiplyng by 1.

In this problem, you will write out a loop in R to apply a matrix over and over again. Here is an example for you to use to compare with. First, define a vector \\(v\\) and a matrix \\(A\\) and multiply \\(Av\\). v = c(10,90) A = cbind(c(.9,.1),c(.5,.5)) A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 54 ## [2,] 46 If we want to appy \\(A\\) to \\(v\\) again and again, we can keep multiplying by \\(A\\): A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 71.6 ## [2,] 28.4 A %*% A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 78.64 ## [2,] 21.36 A %*% A %*% A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 81.456 ## [2,] 18.544 It is better to write a loop to do something like this. The following loop will multiply by A 10 times. Try changing the 10 to 4 (and compare with above). Try changing the 10 to 100. N = 10 # the number of times that we will multiply by A w = c(10,90) # the starting value for (i in 1:N) { # loop as the index i goes from 1 to N w = A %*% w # multiply Aw and replace w with this new vector } w # show the final value of w ## [,1] ## [1,] 83.32564 ## [2,] 16.67436 11.5 Matrix Inverses Give a square matrix ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 -6 1 ## [2,] -2 1 0 ## [3,] -7 5 -1 You find its inverse using solve: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 3 2 ## [3,] 3 8 2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0 ## [2,] 1.776357e-15 1.000000e+00 0 ## [3,] 3.552714e-15 1.776357e-15 1 Note that if you look closely at the last matrix, it is within round off error of the identity. For example, the number 1.776357 e-15 is 0.000000000000001776357. To make it look more like the identity, you can use the command zapsmall, which converts very small numbers like this to 0. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 What happens if you try to invert a matrix that is not invertible. For example in the following matrix, the third column is the sum of the first two, so the columns are linearly dependent. If we try to inverti it A = cbind(c(10,-2,-7),c(-6,1,5),c(4,-1,-2)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 -6 4 ## [2,] -2 1 -1 ## [3,] -7 5 -2 solve(A) ## Error in solve.default(A): system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 5.84328e-18 We get the error that the matrix is singular. This is another term for non-invertible.

I will hand it out right away, even a few minutes early, so you can start right on time. You must turn it in by 9:35 (for the 8:30 class) and 10:45 for the 10:50 class). No exceptions. The next class needs to come in and get started. No calculators are allowed, and none are needed. If row reductions are needed, they will be easy (integer) calculations, and there will not be many. It will be closed book but you can bring a 3\" x 5\" notecard with notes written on both sides. These notes should be hand written by you. You do not need to turn in the note card with the exam. There will be some basic calculations, but the problems will focus more on the ideas than on the calculations. I will ask some problems that are very similar to homework problems, Edfinity problems, and examples from class or the videos. I will ask other problems that are somewhat different from things you have done. On these, you are to apply your knowledge in a slightly new setting to demonstrate an even higher mastery of the material. You will be allowed to re-write one problem to earn back half of the points that you lost. This will be due the class period after I hand the exam back.

Here is another problem in which the goal is to interpret the meaning of matrix multiplication. Here is a graph of the network of domestic airline flights in Korea. They are not located geographically in the plane, but there is a connection if there is a direct flight from one airport to the other. It is common to study these networks using a matrix called the adjacency matrix. Here is the adjacency matrix of this network.

Square the matrix, i.e., compute \\(A^2\\). This amounts to dotting the rows of \\(A\\) with the columns of \\(A\\). Decide what the entries of \\(A^2\\) mean in terms of the network. Multiply \\(A^2\\) by the all 1s vector \\(v\\). What do the entries of that vector mean. 12.2.15 Suppose that you are given four linearly dependent vectors, \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\mathsf{v}_4\\), in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). And suppose that you have a linear transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to\\mathbb{R}^m\\). State precisely what it means for \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\mathsf{v}_3, \\mathsf{v}_4\\) to be linearly dependent.

Therefore \\(\\mathbb{0} \\in U \\cap W\\). Let \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 \\in U \\cap W\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_2 \\in U \\cap W\\). We know that \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 \\in U\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_2 \\in U\\). Since \\(U\\) is a subspace, we have \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 \\in U\\). We know that \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 \\in W\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}_2 \\in W\\). Since \\(W\\) is a subspace, we have \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 \\in W\\). Therefore \\(\\mathsf{v}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_2 \\in U \\cap W\\). Let \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in U \\cap W\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). We know that \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in U\\) and \\(c \\in R\\). Since \\(U\\) is a subspace, we have \\(c \\mathsf{v} \\in U\\). We know that \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in W\\) and \\(c \\in R\\). Since \\(W\\) is a subspace, we have \\(c \\mathsf{v} \\in W\\). Therefore \\(c \\mathsf{v} \\in U \\cap W\\). False. Here is an example that shows this is not always true. Let \\(V= \\mathbb{R}^2\\), \\(U = \\{ { x \\choose 0} \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}\\) and \\(W= \\{ { 0 \\choose y} \\mid y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}\\). The set \\(U \\cup W\\) is not closed under addition. For example, \\({1 \\choose 0} + {0 \\choose 1} = { 1 \\choose 1} \\notin U \\cup W\\). True. Since \\(U\\) and \\(W\\) are subspaces, we know that \\(\\mathbb{0} \\in U\\) and \\(\\mathbb{0} \\in W\\). Therefore \\(\\mathbb{0} = \\mathbb{0} + \\mathbb{0} \\in U + W\\). Let \\(\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_1 \\in U + W\\) and \\(\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_2 \\in U + W\\), where \\(\\mathsf{u}_1, \\mathsf{u}_2 \\in U\\) and \\(\\mathsf{w}_1, \\mathsf{w}_2 \\in W\\). Then \\[ (\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_1) + (\\mathsf{u}_2 + \\mathsf{w}_2) = (\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{u}_2) + (\\mathsf{w}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_2) \\] and \\(\\mathsf{u}_3 = (\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{u}_2) \\in U\\) (because \\(U\\) is a subspace) and \\(\\mathsf{w}_3 = (\\mathsf{w}_1 + \\mathsf{w}_2) \\in W\\) (because \\(W\\) is a subspace). Therefore \\((\\mathsf{u}_1 + \\mathsf{v}_1) + (\\mathsf{u}_2 + \\mathsf{w}_2) = \\mathsf{u}_3 + \\mathsf{w}_3 \\in U + W\\). Let \\(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{w} \\in U + W\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Then \\(c(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{w}) = c \\mathsf{u} + c \\mathsf{w}\\). We know that \\(c \\mathsf{u} \\in U\\) (since \\(U\\) is a subspace) and \\(c \\mathsf{w} \\in W\\) (since \\(W\\) is a subspace). Therefore \\(c(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{w}) = c \\mathsf{u} + c \\mathsf{w} \\in U+W\\). 13.3.5 A basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\) is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\) is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\\\1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\\\0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\0 \\\\ 1\\\\ 0 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] 13.3.6 Using R we find: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 5 2 -4 ## [2,] 3 10 2 8 ## [3,] 4 15 4 4 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 0 -2.0 16 ## [2,] 0 1 0.8 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 0.0 0 A basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\) is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 10 \\\\ 15 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] A basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\) is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -0.8 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix} -16 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] 13.3.7 A = cbind(c(1,-1,-2),c(2,-1,1),c(-1,-1,-8)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 -1 ## [2,] -1 -1 -1 ## [3,] -2 1 -8 rref(A) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 3 ## [2,] 0 1 -2 ## [3,] 0 0 0 No they are not a basis.
