# SVD and Image Compression

[Download this Rmd file](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/math236_f20/blob/main/12-image-compression.Rmd)

Today we will use the `svd` command to find the Singular Value Decomposition of an $m \times n$ matrix.
We will practice reading the output of this command and finding bases for the four fundamental subspaces of a matrix.
Then we will look at a cool application of SVD: image compression!

## Singular Value Decomposition

Let's start by looking at the SVD for a couple of matrices. For each one: 

a. Determine the rank of $A$
b. Identify the basis for each of the four fundamental subspaces
$$
\mbox{Nul}(A), \qquad \mbox{Col}(A), \qquad \mbox{Row}(A), \qquad \mbox{Nul}(A^{\top}).
$$
c. Pick a vector $\mathsf{x}$ from the basis for $\mbox{Nul}(A)$ and confirm that $A \mathsf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
d. Pick a vector $\mathsf{y}$ from the basis for $\mbox{Col}(A)$ and confirm that $\mathsf{y}$ can be written as the a linear combination of the columns of $A$.
e. Find the spectral decomposition of $A$
f. Use the spectral decomposition to create approximations of matrix $A$ and then compare the quality of the approximation to the size of the gaps of the singular values.



### SVD of a Wide Matrix

Here is a $4 \times 5$ matrix $A$.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
(A = cbind(c(1,-1,1,0),c(-2,3,0,2),c(1,-1,1,0),c(0,1,4,0),c(1,-1,5,-4)))

```

Let's call `svd(A)` and see what we get.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
(decomp = svd(A))

```

The return value has three attributes: 

* `decomp$d`: these are the singular values $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3, \sigma_4$. Note that $\sigma_4=0$.
* `decomp$u`: the $4 \times 4$ matrix whose columns are the left singular vectors $\mathsf{u}_1, \mathsf{u}_1, \mathsf{u}_1, \mathsf{u}_1$ corresponding to the singular values. 
* `decomp$v`: the $5 \times 4$ matrix whose columns are right singular vectors the right singular vectors $\mathsf{v}_1, \mathsf{v}_2, \mathsf{v}_3, \mathsf{v}_4$ corresponding to the singular values. The final vector $\mathsf{v}_5$ is missing!

**Note:** The columns of the matrix `decomp$v$` are singular vectors (not the rows).

**Warning!** We were expecting `decomp$v` to be a $5 \times 5$ matrix, and R only returned a $5 \times 4$ matrix. What is wrong!? The missing column is the final orthonormal vector $\mathsf{v}_5$ from $\mbox{Nul}(A)$.  

#### Why has R Omitted this Vector? 

The answer is that **RStudio is being efficient.** R has omitted vector $\mathsf{v}_5$ because we do not need this vector to create the spectral decomposition of $A$. That spectral decomposition is
$$
A = \sigma_1 \mathsf{u}_1 \mathsf{v}_1^{\top} + \sigma_2 \mathsf{u}_2 \mathsf{v}_2^{\top} +  \sigma_3 \mathsf{u}_3 \mathsf{v}_3^{\top} +  \sigma_4 \mathsf{u}_4 \mathsf{v}_4^{\top}.
$$
Note that we do not use the vector $\mathsf{v}_5$. So R didn't calculate it for us (to save computation time). If $A$ had been a $10 \times 4$ matrix, this would be a pretty good idea: why find 6 vectors that we don't need?

And don't worry: we can easily extend the columns of `decomp$u` into an orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^5$. One simple way is to find a basis for the orthogonal complement of $\mbox{span}(\mathsf{v}_1\mathsf{v}_2,\mathsf{v}_3,\mathsf{v}_4)$. We could do this by manually by finding an orthogonal basis for the nullspace of `t(decomp$v)`. 

If you take MATH 365 Computational Linear Algebra, you will learn more about the $QR$-decomposition. That gives a fast way to fill in the missing vectors if you need them. 


**Pro Tip:** When you use `svd` on a rectangular matrix, just remember that some of the singular vectors are missing. 

* If $m > n$ then there are $m-n$ missing columns of $U$, all lying in $\mbox{Nul}(A^{\top})$. 
* If $n > m$ then there are $n-m$ missing columns of $V$, all lying in $\mbox{Nul(A)}$. 



#### The Four Fundamental Subspaces of $A$

Keeping this is mind, let's characterize the four fundamental subspaces of our example $5 \times 4$ matrix $A.$

* The matrix $A$ has rank $3$ because there are three nonzero signular values.
*  $\mbox{Row}(A)$ is 3-dimensional with basis `decomp$v[,1:3]`
* $\mbox{Nul}(A)$ is 2-dimensional because $\sigma_4=0$ and there is $5-4=1$ missing left right singular vector. We can use `decomp$v[,4]` as one basis vector. We can find the remaining $5-4=1$ vector by finding the nullspace of `t(decomp$v)`.
* $\mbox{Col}(A)$ is 3-dimensional with basis `decomp$u[,1:3]`
* $\mbox{Nul}(A^{\top})$ is 1-dimensional. The vector `decomp$u[,4]` is a basis. 

### Your Turn: SVD of a Square Matrix

Characterize the four subspaces of this $5x5$ matrix. Note that since $A$ is square, the matrices $U$ and $V$ will both contain a full basis for $\mathbb{R}^5$.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
(A = cbind(c(-3,5,-3,6,-1),c(-1,-2,-1,2,-4),c(9,-4,9,-18,14),c(3,-4,3,-6,3),c(-2,11,-2,4,11)))

```


### Your Turn: SVD of a Tall Matrix

Characterize the four subspaces of this $6x4$ matrix. This time around, we will be missing $6-4=2$ of the left singular vectors that we need to extend `svd(A)$u$ into a basis of $\mathbb{R}^6$. These two singular vectors complete the basis for $\mbox{Nul(A^{\top})}$.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
(A = cbind(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3))

```


## Image Compression



### Converting a JPEG image into a Matrix

You may need to install the `jpeg` and `raster` packages. Let's find out.

* Click on the 'Packages' tab in the lower right window
* Either search or scroll to see if the the `jpeg` and `raster` are there. 
* If so, then click the checkbox to load the package into memory.
If the package is missing, then uncomment and run  the folllowing code chunk
```{r, echo=TRUE}
#install.packages('jpeg')
#install.packages('raster')
```

You've probably heard of JPEG image files. The `jpeg` package will allow us to import those images into R. The JPEG format uses image compression. So we need to turn them into a **raster (bitmap) image** which is a rectangular grid of pixels or dots. In other words a raster image is a matrix. The package `raster` will do this conversion for us.

```{r,message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(jpeg)
library(raster)
```





The following defines two helper functions

* `get_image(filename)` reads in a JPEG file and convert it into a raster image.
* `plot_image(img)` creates a plot of the raster image

```{r, echo=TRUE}


# converts a JPEG file into a raster image (a numerical matrix)
# if the JPEG is a color image, it is converted to black and white.
get_image <- function(filename) {
  # read the jpeg file
  img = readJPEG(readBin(filename,"raw",1e6))
  img.dim = dim(img)
  
  # if this is a color image, we need to turn it into a grayscale image
  img = img[,,1]+img[,,2]+img[,,3]
  img <- img/max(img)
  img.dim = dim(img)
  
  return (img)
}


plot_image = function(img,...) {
  plot(2:1, type='n',xlab=" ",ylab= " ",...)
  rasterImage(img, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)
}




```



Let start by reading in a picture of a tartan.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=TRUE}
where.tartan = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Burberry.jpg"
img = get_image(where.tartan)
#plot_image(img,main="Image")

dim(img)
prod(dim(img)) # prod(vec) = product of the entries of vec


```


Each entry of `img` is a value in $[0,1]$. This is the  **grayscale value** of a single pixel: value 0 corresponds to white and value 1 corresponds to black.  The matrix `img` is a $335 \times 333$ matrix. So to store the image, we need to store $111,555$  floating point numbers (!). You can see compression methods are essential in practice.



### SVD of a Raster Image


The `img` variable is just a matrix. So we can find its singular value decomposition. We find that there are some large gaps in the singular values.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
decomp =svd(img)$d
#plot(decomp,pch=19,cex=.5,col='blue')
#plot(decomp,pch=19,cex=.5,col='blue',ylim=c(0,5))
decomp[1:10]
```

### SVD Approximation of the Image


Now let's create an SVD approximation of the image. Here is some helper code for us to use. The functions that you will call are

* `plot_svd_approx(img, k)`: create the spectral decomposition corresponding to the $k$ largest singular values in the spectral decomposition.
* `get_svd_approx_error(img, k)`: reports the average pixel error of the approximation.
```{r,echo=TRUE}

# returns the spectral decomposition matrix for the first k singular values
svd_approx = function(A,k = floor(1/2*min(nrow(A),ncol(A)))) {
  decomp = svd(A)
  sings = decomp$d
  U = decomp$u
  V = decomp$v
  if(k==1)
    D=matrix(sings[1],nrow=1,ncol=1)
  else
    D=diag(sings[1:k])
  M=U[,1:k]%*%D%*%t(V[,1:k])
  return(M)
}


# gets the svd approximation of the image
get_svd_approx_img <- function(img,k) {
  approxIm = svd_approx(img,k)
  approxIm[approxIm<0] = 0
  approxIm[approxIm>1] = 1
  
  return (approxIm)
}

# returns the average pixel error for the svd approximation of the image
get_svd_approx_error <-  function(img, k) {
  approxImg = get_svd_approx_img(img,k)
  return  = mean(abs(img - approxImg))
}

# plots the SVD approximation of the image
plot_svd_approx=function(img,k){
  approxIm = get_svd_approx_img(img,k)
  plot(1:2, type='n')
  rasterImage(approxIm, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)

}




```

And here we show the singular value approximation with increasing numbers of singular values:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=TRUE}
#plot_svd_approx(img,1)
get_svd_approx_error(img,1)
```


### SVD of a Lighthouse

Now let's see how SVD does with this picture of a lighthouse. Use the appropriate code above to explore the SVD approximations of this lighthouse. How big must $k$ be in order to get an okay approximation? to get an approximation that you can't distinguish from the original?


```{r, echo=TRUE}
where.lighthouse  = "https://images.unsplash.com/6/lighthouse.jpg"
```


### Your Turn

Here are some JPEG files available on the web for you to try. Or you can use an image of your own choice! Have fun!
```{r, echo=TRUE}

# some jpeg images available on the web
where.cameraman = "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/cameraman_small.jpg"
where.tiger = "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/b5/0b/f2b50b1cbdb7cd16fef50f5641d41e77.jpg"
where.flower= "https://www.amylamb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Gerbera-320x320.jpg"
where.pattern  = "https://previews.123rf.com/images/noppanun/noppanun1411/noppanun141100046/33287656-black-and-white-geometric-seamless-pattern-with-triangle-and-trapezoid-abstract-background-vector-ep.jpg"
