# Week 1 Learning Goals



Here are the knowledge and skills you should master by the end of this first, shorter week.


## Solving Linear Equations

I should be able to do the following tasks:

* Identify linear systems from nonlinear systems
* Create a linear system to solve a variety of applied scenarios
* Convert between a linear system and an augmented matrix
* Row reduce an augmented matrix into Row Echelon Form (REF) and Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)
* Use REF to determine whether a linear system is consistent or inconsistent
* Use REF to determine whether a consistent system has a unique solution or an infinite number of solutions
* Use RREF to find explicit equations for the solution set of a consistent system

## RStudio

I should be able to do the following tasks:

* Log in to [Macalester's RStudio server](http://rstudio.macalester.edu/)
* Upload R Markdown files to RStudio
* Knit R Markdown to produce HTML
* Use RStudio to create vectors and matrices
* Use the ``rref`` command from ``pracma`` to solve a linear system



## Vocabulary

I should know and be able to use and explain the following terms:

* elementary row operation (and be able to state them)
* augmented matrix
* REF and RREF
* pivot position
* basic variable (pivot variable)
* free variable
* consistent system and inconsistent system

## Conceptual Thinking

I should understand and be able to perform the following conceptual tasks:

* Model 2-dimensional linear systems as the intersections of lines
* Model 3-dimensional linear systems as the intersections of planes
