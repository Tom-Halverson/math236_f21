# Week 4 Learning Goals



Here are the knowledge and skills you should master by the end of the fourth week.


## Vector Spaces and the Determinant

I should be able to do the following **tasks**:

* Prove/disprove that a subset of a vector space is a subspace.
* Prove/disprove that a set of vectors is linearly dependent.
* Prove/disprove that a set of vectors span a vector space (or a subspace).
* Find the kernel and image of $T(\mathsf{x}) = Ax$.
* Determine whether a set of vectors is a basis.
* Find a basis for $\mathrm{Nul}(A)$ and a basis for $\mathrm{Col}(A)$.
* Find the change-of-coordinate matrix $P_{\mathcal{B}}$ from basis ${\mathcal{B}}$ to the standard basis $\mathcal{S}$.
* Use matrix inverses (and RStudio) to find the change-of-coordinate matrix $P_{\mathcal{B}}^{-1}$ from basis ${\mathcal{S}}$ to the standard basis $\mathcal{B}$.
* Find the coordinate vector with respect to a given basis.
* Find the dimension of a vector space (or subspace) by finding or verifying a basis.
* Find the determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix by hand.
* Find the determinant of a $3 \times 3$ matrix by using row operations/cofactor expansion/permutation method.
* Use RStudio to calculate the determinant of a square matrix.
* Use $\det(A)$ to decide whether the square matrix $A$ is invertible.

## Vocabulary

I should know and be able to use and explain the following **terms** or **properties**. 

* every one of [these Important Definitions][Important Definitions]
* subspace
* null space and column space of a matrix
* kernel and image of a linear transformation
* basis
* coordinate vector with respect to a basis
* change-of-coordinates matrix
* the coordinate vector with respect to a basis
* the dimension of a vector space (or a subspace)
* determinant

## Conceptual Thinking

I should understand and be able to explain the following **concepts**:

* A vector space consists of a collection of vectors and all of their linear combinations.
* A subspace is a subset of a vector space that is *also* a vector space by itself (closed under linear combinations).
* The solutions to $A \mathsf{x} = \mathbb{0}$ form a subspace.
* The span of the columns of $A$ form a subspace.
* How the kernel and image of $T(\mathsf{x}) = Ax$ correspond to the nullspace and columnspace of $A$.
* Every basis of a given vector space (or subspace) contains the same number of vectors.
* Why every vector in a vector space has a unique representation as a linear combination of a given basis ${\mathcal{B}}$.
* How dimension relates to span and linear independence.
* Interpret $\det(A)$ as a measure the expansion/contraction of "volumes" in $\mathbb{R}^n$ under the linear transformation $T(\mathsf{x})=A\mathsf{x}$.
