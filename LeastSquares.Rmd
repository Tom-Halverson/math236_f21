# Solving Basic Least Squares Problems

```{r}
require('pracma')
```


```{r}
A = cbind(c(1,0,1,2),c(2,1,2,1))  # the matrix A
v = c(3,5,9,9)  # the vector to be projected
# the normal equations (just to look at)
t(A)%*%A  
t(A)%*%v
# solve the normal equations
xhat = solve(t(A)%*%A,t(A)%*%v)  # solve(A,b) solves Ax = b
xhat
# get the projected vector
vhat = A %*% xhat
vhat
# residual and its length
r = v - vhat
sqrt(dot(r,r))
# confirming that r is in the orthogonal complement
t(A) %*% r
```
